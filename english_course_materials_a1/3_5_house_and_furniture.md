# 3.5. House and furniture (3.5)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we are going to learn about houses and furniture. Knowing the words for things in your home is very important for everyday conversation and helps you describe where you live.

## Explanation

Let's talk about a house. A house is a building where people live. Most houses have different rooms inside. Some common rooms are the living room, the bedroom, the kitchen, and the bathroom. The living room is where you relax and watch television. The bedroom is where you sleep. The kitchen is where you cook food. And the bathroom is where you wash yourself.

Inside each of these rooms, we have furniture. Furniture are things like chairs, tables, beds, and sofas. A chair is where you sit. A table is where you can put things, like plates or books. A bed is where you sleep at night. And a sofa is a long, comfortable seat where you can relax. For example, "I like to sit on the sofa and watch TV".
