# 1.2. Numbers from 1 to 100 (1.2)

## Introduction

Hello! Welcome to our lesson on numbers from one to one hundred. Learning numbers is very important for English language learners, especially at the A1 level, because we use numbers every day. We use them to talk about age, prices, time, and many other things. Let's begin!

## Explanation

In this section, we’ll explore the numbers from one to one hundred. It’s good to learn these numbers carefully. The numbers from one to ten are: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten. These are the building blocks for other numbers.

After ten, we have eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen. Notice that many of these end in “-teen.”

Then comes twenty. After twenty, we combine twenty with the numbers one to nine, like this: twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, and twenty-nine.

Next is thirty. We do the same as with twenty: thirty-one, thirty-two, and so on. This pattern continues with forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, and ninety. So, we have forty-one, fifty-two, sixty-three, seventy-four, eighty-five, and ninety-six, and so on.

Finally, we have one hundred. Remember that you can also say "a hundred." For example, "I have a hundred dollars."

## Examples

Now, let’s look at some examples of how we use numbers in everyday conversations.

*   I am ten years old.
*   The book costs twenty dollars.
*   My house number is thirty-five.
*   There are forty students in the class.
*   I need to buy one hundred apples.

Here are some useful phrases using numbers:

*   How old are you?
*   What is your phone number?
*   How much does it cost?

Here are some more example sentences:

* She has eleven cats.
* The store is open until nine o'clock.
* There are seventy-seven birds in the sky.
