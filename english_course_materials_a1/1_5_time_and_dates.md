# 1.5. Time and dates (1.5)

## Introduction

Hello! In this lesson, we are going to learn about time and dates. This is important because you will use time and dates every day to make plans, understand schedules, and talk about your life. It will help you understand when things are happening.

## Explanation

First, let’s talk about time. We use numbers to tell the time. We have hours and minutes. There are 24 hours in a day, but we usually use 12 hours and say "a.m." for the morning and "p.m." for the afternoon and evening. For example, 7 a.m. is seven in the morning, and 7 p.m. is seven in the evening.

Then, let’s look at dates. Dates tell us about the day, month, and year. In English, we usually say the month first, then the day, and then the year. For example, July 4, 2024. We often use ordinal numbers for the day. Instead of saying "four," we say "fourth." So we can say "July fourth, two thousand twenty-four."

We use words like "today," "yesterday," and "tomorrow" to talk about days close to us. Today is the day we are in now. Yesterday was the day before, and tomorrow will be the day after.

## Examples

Now, let’s look at some examples. Here are some useful phrases to help you talk about time and dates.

- What time is it?
- It is 3 o'clock.
- It is half past two.
- What is the date today?
- Today is Monday.
- My birthday is on June 10th.

Here are some short example sentences:

- I wake up at 7 a.m.
- We eat lunch at 1 p.m.
