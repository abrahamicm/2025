# 3.3. Family and relationships (3.3)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about family and relationships. This is a very important topic because it helps us talk about the people we love and who are important in our lives. Learning these words will help you introduce your family to new friends and understand when others talk about their families.

## Explanation

Family means the group of people who are related to you. These can be people you live with, or people who live far away. We use different words to describe the people in our family.

For example, *mother* is the woman who gave birth to you. *Father* is the man who gave birth to you. These are also often called *mom* and *dad*. If you have brothers and sisters, those are your siblings. A *brother* is a boy or man who has the same parents as you. A *sister* is a girl or woman who has the same parents as you.

Your mother and father have parents too; these are your grandparents. Your father's mother is your *grandmother*, and your father's father is your *grandfather*. The same goes for your mother's parents. We sometimes shorten *grandmother* and *grandfather* to *grandma* and *grandpa*.

Relationships refer to how people are connected to each other. You have a relationship with your family, your friends, and your classmates. We can describe these relationships with words like *love*, *friendship*, and *respect*.
