## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about reading and understanding simple public signs and notices. This is very important for you as a new English language learner because it helps you understand what's happening around you every day and stay safe. These signs can tell you where to go, what you can do, or what you cannot do.

## Explanation

Public signs and notices are short messages that give us information. They are usually found in public places, such as parks, shops, streets, and buildings. The words used in these signs are often simple and easy to understand, but it's still important to learn what they mean. For example, you might see a sign that says "Entrance." This means this is where you can go in. Or, you might see a sign that says “Exit.” This means this is where you can go out. These signs help everyone understand the rules and stay safe in public places.
