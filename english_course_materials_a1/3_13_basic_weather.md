# 3.13. Basic weather

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about basic weather vocabulary. Knowing how to talk about the weather is very useful for everyday conversations. It’s a common topic to start a conversation, especially with new people. You can use this knowledge when traveling or even just talking to friends.

## Explanation

The weather describes what is happening outside. It can be sunny, rainy, windy, or cloudy. We use words to describe the weather, so other people understand what it's like outside. For example, if it's sunny, we say "It is sunny." If water is falling from the sky, we say "It is raining." Understanding the different words will help you describe what you see. Weather changes every day and even during the same day.

The temperature tells us how hot or cold it is. We can say "It is hot," or "It is cold." If it is not too hot and not too cold, we can say "It is warm."
