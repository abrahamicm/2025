# 2.11. Prepositions of time (in, on, at) (2.11)

## Introduction
In this lesson, we will learn about prepositions of time: in, on, and at. These little words tell us *when* something happens, and they are very important for speaking and understanding English. Learning them will help you talk about your day, your plans, and your life.

## Explanation
Prepositions of time tell us when something happens. We use "in", "on", and "at" with different kinds of times.

We use **in** for longer periods of time, like months, seasons, years, centuries, and parts of the day. For example, we say, "I was born *in* July." Another example is, "We go swimming *in* the summer." And another example is, "I study English *in* the evening."

We use **on** for specific days and dates. For example, we say, "My birthday is *on* June 15th." Another example is, "We have a party *on* Saturday." And another example is, "I don't work *on* Sundays."

We use **at** for specific times of the day, for holidays without "day," and for certain phrases. For example, we say, "I wake up *at* 7 o'clock." Another example is, "We eat dinner *at* noon." And another example is, "We have a big meal *at* Christmas." We also often say "at night".

Now, let’s remember this simple rule.  Think of it like this: "in" is for big things (like months and years), "on" is for things in the middle (like days and dates), and "at" is for small things (like specific times).

## Examples
