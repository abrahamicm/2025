# 1.1. English alphabet and basic pronunciation (1.1)

## Introduction

Welcome to the lesson on the English alphabet and basic pronunciation! This is a very important topic for English learners at the A1 level because it's the foundation for reading, writing, and speaking English correctly. Learning the alphabet and how to pronounce each letter will help you understand and communicate more effectively.

## Explanation

Let's start with the English alphabet. The English alphabet has 26 letters. These letters are divided into two types: vowels and consonants. Vowels are A, E, I, O, and U. The other letters are consonants. It's helpful to remember that vowels often have more than one sound. For example, the letter "A" can sound like in the word "apple" or like in the word "cake". Consonants usually have one main sound.

Pronunciation is how we say words. Each letter has a sound, and learning these sounds is very important. Some letters are easy to pronounce, and some are a little bit harder. We need to practice listening and repeating to improve our pronunciation. For instance, the letter "B" is pronounced in the word "book", and the letter "C" is pronounced in the word "cat". Pay attention to how your mouth and tongue move when you say these words.

Sometimes, the same letter can have different sounds depending on the word. The letter "G", for example, sounds different in "go" than it does in "giraffe". Don't worry if this seems confusing at first. With practice, you'll learn these differences.

## Examples

Now, letâ€™s look at some examples to help you understand the English alphabet and basic pronunciation better.

Here are some common phrases:

*   Hello
*   Goodbye
*   Thank you
*   You're welcome
*   My name is...

Here are some useful vocabulary words:

*   Apple
