# 4.7. Talking about daily routine (4.7)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn how to talk about our daily routine. This is important for A1 learners because it helps you describe your day, share information about yourself, and understand other people. Talking about your daily routine is a great way to practice basic English vocabulary and sentence structure.

## Explanation

Talking about your daily routine means describing the things you usually do every day. It's about what you do from the time you wake up until you go to sleep. To talk about this, we use simple present tense. This tense is used for habits and routines. For example, you might say, "I wake up at 7 o'clock" or "I eat breakfast at 8 o'clock."

We often use adverbs of frequency, like *always*, *usually*, *sometimes*, *often*, and *never*, to describe how often we do things. For example, "I *always* brush my teeth after breakfast" or "I *sometimes* go to the park in the afternoon." Remember, these adverbs usually come *before* the main verb, but *after* the verb "to be". So, you would say "I am *always* happy" but "I *usually* eat lunch at noon." Describing times of the day, like "in the morning," "in the afternoon," and "in the evening," also helps to explain your daily routine clearly.

## Examples

Now, let’s look at some examples of phrases and sentences we can use to talk about our daily routine.

*   Wake up
*   Get up

*   Eat breakfast
*   Go to school
*   Study English
