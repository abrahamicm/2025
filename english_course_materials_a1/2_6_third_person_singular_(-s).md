# 2.6. Third person singular (-s) (2.6)

## Introduction

This lesson is very important for you because it will help you speak about other people correctly in English. We will learn about adding "-s" to verbs when talking about he, she, or it.

## Explanation

In English, when we talk about someone else doing something, we sometimes need to add an "-s" to the end of the verb. This happens when we talk about one person who is a "he" or a "she", or when we talk about "it". We call this the "third person singular".

For example, if I say "I walk", I do not add an "-s". But if I want to say that my brother walks, I say "He walks".  See how we added the "-s" to "walk"?

It's important to remember that this mostly happens in the present tense, when we are talking about things happening now or regularly.

For "I", "you", "we" and "they", we don't add an "-s". For example: "I eat", "You eat", "We eat", "They eat".  But for "he", "she", and "it", we add an "-s".  For example: "He eats", "She eats", "It eats".

## Examples

Now, let's look at some examples to help you understand better.

Here are some common phrases:
- He works.
- She plays.
- It sleeps.
- He likes pizza.

Here are some example sentences:
