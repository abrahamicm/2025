# 2.7. There is / There are (2.7)

## Introduction

Welcome, everyone! Today, we are learning about “There is” and “There are.” This is very important for talking about things that exist or are located somewhere. Knowing how to use “There is” and “There are” will help you describe places and objects clearly in English.

## Explanation

In this section, we’ll explore how to use "There is" and "There are" correctly. We use “There is” to talk about one thing. For example, you might say, “There is a book on the table.” This means you see one book.

We use “There are” to talk about more than one thing. For instance, you could say, “There are two chairs in the room.” This indicates that you see more than one chair.

Remember this simple rule: "There is" for singular, meaning one. "There are" for plural, meaning more than one. It’s all about counting!

## Examples

Now, let’s look at some examples. Here are some useful phrases.

*   A book
*   An apple
*   Some pencils
*   Many cars

Here are some example sentences:

*   There is a cat sleeping on the sofa.
*   There is an apple on the plate.
