# 6.1. Writing short notes and messages (6.1)

## Introduction

Learning to write short notes and messages is very important, even for beginners. It helps you communicate quickly and easily with your friends, family, and teachers. These messages can be used to ask questions, give information, or make simple requests.

## Explanation

Writing short notes and messages means writing something that is easy to understand. You don't need to use long sentences or complicated words. Keep it simple and to the point. It is important to write clearly, so the reader understands your message. You can write notes on paper, send text messages on your phone, or write emails. When you write a short note, think about who you are writing to. A message to your teacher might be a little different than a message to your best friend. For example, you might write, "See you later!" to a friend, but you could write, "Goodbye, and have a good day," to a teacher. Using correct grammar is also helpful.

## Examples

Now, let's look at some examples of common phrases and short notes.

Here are some useful phrases:

*   "Hello, I am..."
*   "Goodbye, see you later!"
*   "Thank you very much!"
*   "Sorry, I am late."
*   "Can you help me, please?"

Here are some example sentences:

*   "Hello, I am John. I am a new student."
*   "Goodbye, see you later! I have to go home."
*   "Thank you very much for your help with my homework!"
*   "Sorry, I am late. The bus was delayed."
*   "Can you help me, please? I can't find my book."
