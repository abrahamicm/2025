# 2.10. Prepositions of place (in, on, under, next to, between) (2.10)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about prepositions of place. Prepositions of place are words that tell us where something is located. Understanding them is very important for describing locations and understanding directions in English, especially when you are just starting to learn.

## Explanation

Prepositions of place tell us the position of something. We will learn about five common prepositions: in, on, under, next to, and between.

*   **In:** "In" means something is inside a container or an enclosed space. For example, the apple is in the box.

*   **On:** "On" means something is touching the top surface of something else. For example, the book is on the table.

*   **Under:** "Under" means something is below something else. For example, the cat is under the chair.

*   **Next to:** "Next to" means something is beside something else. It is very close to the other thing. For example, the lamp is next to the bed.

*   **Between:** "Between" means something is in the middle of two other things. For example, the park is between the school and the library.

## Examples

Now, let's look at some examples. Here are some useful phrases:

*   in the box
