# 4.10. Talking about abilities (can/can't) (4.10)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we're going to learn how to talk about things we can do and things we can't do. This is very important for telling people about your skills and abilities. It's also helpful for asking others about what they can do.

## Explanation

We use the word "can" to say that we are able to do something. For example, I can speak English. This means I have the ability to speak English.

We use "can't" to say that we are not able to do something. "Can't" is short for "cannot". For example, I can't fly. This means I don't have the ability to fly.

The structure is very simple:

Subject + can + verb (base form)
Subject + can't + verb (base form)

For example:
* I can swim.
* He can play the piano.
* They can speak Spanish.

And:
* I can't dance very well.
