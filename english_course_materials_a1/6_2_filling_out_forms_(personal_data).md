# 6.2. Filling out forms (personal data) (6.2)

## Introduction
In this lesson, we will learn about filling out forms with your personal information. This is important because you will need to fill out forms when you go to school, see a doctor, or get a library card. Knowing how to do this will help you in many everyday situations.

## Explanation
Filling out forms means writing your information on a piece of paper or on a computer. These forms ask for things like your name, address, and phone number. It's important to write clearly and honestly so people understand your information.

For example, a form might ask for your "First Name." This is the name your parents gave you, like "Maria." It might also ask for your "Last Name" or "Family Name." This is your family's name, like "Garcia."

Another important piece of information is your "Address." This is where you live. Your address usually has a street number, street name, city, and country. For example, you might write: "123 Main Street, Anytown, USA."

Finally, a form may ask for your "Date of Birth." This is the day you were born. You need to write the day, month, and year. For example, "10 January 2000" means you were born on the tenth of January in the year 2000.

## Examples
Now, let's look at some examples of phrases and vocabulary you might see on a form.

*   First Name
*   Last Name, Family Name
*   Address
*   City
*   Country
*   Date of Birth
*   Phone Number
*   Email Address

Here are some useful phrases for understanding what the form is asking:

*   "Please write your name here."
*   "What is your address?"
*   "Enter your date of birth."
*   "Fill in the following information."

Here are some example sentences showing how to fill out a form:

*   My first name is John.
*   My address is 456 Oak Avenue.
*   My date of birth is 15 May 1995.
