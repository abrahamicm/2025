# 4.1. Greeting and saying goodbye (4.1)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn how to greet people and say goodbye in English. This is very important for A1 learners because it helps you start and end conversations politely and confidently. These are the first steps to making friends and understanding others.

## Explanation

Greetings are how we acknowledge someone when we meet them. They show politeness and respect. There are different greetings for different times of the day and situations. For example, we usually say "Hello" or "Hi" to anyone, but "Good morning" is specifically for the morning. Saying goodbye is just as important. It tells the other person that you are leaving and ends the conversation nicely. Common ways to say goodbye are "Goodbye" and "See you later." Remember to smile and be friendly when you greet and say goodbye to someone.

Now, let's look at some specific situations. If you see someone in the morning, you can say "Good morning!" If you meet someone in the afternoon, you can say "Good afternoon!" And in the evening, you can say "Good evening!" When you are leaving, you might say "Goodbye," "See you later," or simply "Bye."

Here are some useful phrases for greeting someone:

*   Hello
