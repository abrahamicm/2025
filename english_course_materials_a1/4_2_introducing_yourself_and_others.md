# 4.2. Introducing yourself and others (4.2)

## Introduction

Introducing yourself and others is a very important skill, especially when you are learning a new language. It helps you make new friends, start conversations, and feel more confident when speaking English. This lesson will teach you some simple and useful phrases for introducing yourself and other people.

## Explanation

In English, when you meet someone for the first time, it's polite to introduce yourself. You can do this by saying your name. A very common way to do this is to say "Hello, my name is..." or "Hi, I am...". For example, you could say "Hello, my name is Maria." or "Hi, I am John." You can also just say "I'm Maria" or "I'm John."

It's also polite to ask the other person's name. You can say "What's your name?" or "How do you do?". "How do you do?" is a more formal way to ask someone's name, and the correct response is "How do you do?".

When you want to introduce two other people to each other, you say their names and maybe a little something about them. You can say something like "Maria, this is John. John, this is Maria." Another way to say this is "Maria, have you met John? John, have you met Maria?". After that, those people might say "Hello" or "Nice to meet you."

## Examples

Now, let's look at some examples. Here are some useful phrases for introducing yourself:

*   Hello, my name is…
