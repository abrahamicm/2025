# 2.5. Present simple tense (common verbs, affirmative, negative, questions) (2.5)

## Introduction

Welcome! In this lesson, we'll learn about the present simple tense. This is a very important tense for beginners, because we use it to talk about habits, routines, and general facts. Understanding the present simple tense will help you talk about your daily life and understand what other people do.

## Explanation

The present simple tense is used to describe things that are generally true or happen regularly. This includes habits, routines, and facts.

For **affirmative** sentences (sentences that are not negative), we generally use the base form of the verb. For example: "I eat breakfast." "You watch TV." "We live in London." "They play football."

However, there’s a small change with the third-person singular (he, she, it). We usually add "-s" or "-es" to the verb. For example: "He eats breakfast." "She watches TV." "It rains a lot here." Remember this important rule.

For **negative** sentences, we usually use "do not" or "does not" before the verb. "Do not" is shortened to "don't," and "does not" is shortened to "doesn't." For example: "I do not eat meat," or "I don't eat meat." "He does not watch movies," or "He doesn't watch movies." Remember to use "does not" or "doesn't" with he, she, and it. The verb itself stays in the base form without the -s or -es.

To form **questions**, we use "do" or "does" at the beginning of the sentence. Again, use "does" with he, she, and it. For example: "Do you like coffee?" "Does she work here?" The verb stays in the base form.
