# 4.5. Expressing likes and dislikes (like/don't like) (4.5)

## Introduction

Learning how to say what you like and don't like is very important for beginners. It helps you share your feelings and connect with others. In this lesson, we will learn simple ways to express our likes and dislikes in English.

## Explanation

In English, we use the words "like" and "don't like" to talk about things we enjoy or don't enjoy. "Like" means you enjoy something. "Don't like" means you do not enjoy something. It's very simple!

For example, you can say "I like cats" if you enjoy cats. You can say "I don't like spiders" if you do not enjoy spiders. Remember to include the subject pronoun "I" at the beginning of the sentence.

We can also use "like" and "don't like" with verbs. For example, "I like swimming," which means you enjoy the activity of swimming. Or "I don't like running," which means you do not enjoy the activity of running.

## Examples

Now, let's look at some examples. Here are some useful phrases.

*   I like.
*   I don't like.

Here are some example sentences:

I like dogs.
I like chocolate.
I don't like broccoli.
