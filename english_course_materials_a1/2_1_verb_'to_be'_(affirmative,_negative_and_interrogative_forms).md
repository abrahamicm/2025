# 2.1. Verb 'to be' (affirmative, negative and interrogative forms) (2.1)

## Introduction

Welcome to our lesson about the verb "to be"! This is a very important verb in English. It is used to describe who you are, where you are, and what things are like. Learning this verb is essential for speaking and understanding basic English.

## Explanation

In this section, we’ll explore the verb "to be" in its affirmative, negative, and interrogative forms. The verb "to be" has different forms depending on the subject. The subjects are: I, you, he, she, it, we, and they.

The affirmative form tells us something *is* true. Here’s how it looks:

*   I **am**
*   You **are**
*   He **is**
*   She **is**
*   It **is**
*   We **are**
*   They **are**

For example: I am happy. You are a student. He is tall.

The negative form tells us something *is not* true. We usually add "not" after the verb "to be".

*   I am **not**
*   You are **not**
*   He is **not**
*   She is **not**
*   It is **not**
*   We are **not**
*   They are **not**

We can also use contractions, which are shorter forms:

*   I'm not
*   You aren't
*   He isn't
*   She isn't
*   It isn't
*   We aren't
*   They aren't

For example: I am not sad. You aren't a teacher. He isn't short.

The interrogative form is used to ask questions. We switch the subject and the verb "to be".

*   **Am** I?
*   **Are** you?
*   **Is** he?
*   **Is** she?
*   **Is** it?
*   **Are** we?
*   **Are** they?

For example: Am I late? Are you ready? Is he a doctor?
