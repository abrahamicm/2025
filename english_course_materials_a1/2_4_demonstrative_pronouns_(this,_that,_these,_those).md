# 2.4. Demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those) (2.4)

## Introduction

In this section, we’ll explore demonstrative pronouns. Learning about words like *this, that, these,* and *those* is very important for beginners because they help you point out things and people around you. They make your speaking and understanding much clearer.

## Explanation

Demonstrative pronouns are words that show or point to specific people or things. We use them to indicate something near or far, and whether there is one thing or many things.

*   *This* is used for one thing that is close to you. For example, "This is my book."
*   *That* is used for one thing that is far from you. For example, "That is her car."
*   *These* is used for many things that are close to you. For example, "These are my friends."
*   *Those* is used for many things that are far from you. For example, "Those are their shoes."

Think of it like pointing. If something is right next to you, you can say *this*. If it's further away, you would say *that*. The same applies to multiple things – *these* for near, and *those* for far. Remember that *this* and *that* are singular, and *these* and *those* are plural.

## Examples

Now, let’s look at some examples. These will help you understand how to use these words in real conversations.

*   Useful Phrases:
    *   "Is this yours?"
    *   "What is that?"
    *   "Are these your keys?"
    *   "Whose are those?"

*   Example Sentences:
    *   This is my house.
    *   That is a beautiful tree.
    *   These are delicious apples.
    *   Those are very tall buildings.
