# 3.2. Personal introductions (3.2)

## Introduction

Personal introductions are very important for English language learners at the A1 level. Knowing how to introduce yourself allows you to start conversations and meet new people. It's a fundamental skill for building relationships and communicating effectively in English.

## Explanation

In this section, we will learn how to introduce ourselves in simple English. Introducing yourself means telling people your name and maybe a few other basic things about you. It's usually the first thing you do when you meet someone new.

You can start by saying "Hello" or "Hi". Then, you can say your name. A common way to say your name is to use the phrase "My name is..." For example, you can say, "Hello, my name is Maria."

Another way to introduce yourself is to say, "I am..." For example, "Hi, I am David." Both phrases are perfectly fine to use.

You might also want to share where you are from. You can say, "I am from..." and then say the name of your country or city. For example, "I am from Italy," or "I am from Rome."

Finally, you might say something nice, like "Nice to meet you." This shows that you are happy to meet the other person.

## Examples

Now, let's look at some examples of personal introductions. Here are some useful phrases:

*   Hello
*   Hi
*   My name is...
*   I am...
*   I am from...
*   Nice to meet you.

Here are some short example sentences that demonstrate how to use these phrases:

Hello, my name is John. Nice to meet you.

Hi, I am Anna. I am from Spain.

My name is Kenji. I am from Japan. Nice to meet you.

Hello, I am Sarah.
