# 6.3. Writing postcards and brief letters (6.3)

## Introduction

Writing postcards and brief letters is a very useful skill, even for beginners! It helps you communicate with friends and family, share your experiences, and practice your English in a fun and practical way. This lesson will teach you how to write simple and effective postcards and short letters.

## Explanation

In this section, we’ll explore the basic structure and language needed to write a postcard or a short letter. A postcard is usually sent from a vacation or a special place. A short letter can be used to say hello, thank someone, or give simple news. Both are usually short and friendly.

When writing a postcard, you usually start with a greeting, like "Dear [Name]," or "Hello [Name],". Then, you write a few sentences about where you are and what you are doing. You can also mention something interesting you saw or experienced. For example, you could write, "I am in Paris. The Eiffel Tower is very tall!". Finally, you end with a closing like "See you soon," or "Best wishes," followed by your name.

For a short letter, the structure is similar. You start with a greeting, write a few sentences about your news or message, and then end with a closing and your name. The language can be a little more personal than a postcard. For example, you could write, "Thank you for the gift. I really liked it!". Remember to keep it short and simple!

## Examples

Now, let’s look at some examples. Here are some useful phrases for writing postcards and short letters:

*   Greetings:
    *   Dear [Name],
    *   Hello [Name],
    *   Hi [Name],

*   Talking about your location:
    *   I am in [Place].
    *   I am visiting [Place].
    *   The weather is [Adjective].

*   Sharing experiences:
    *   I am having a good time.
    *   I saw [Noun].
    *   It is very [Adjective].

*   Closings:
    *   See you soon,
    *   Best wishes,
    *   Love,

Here are some short example sentences:

*   Hello Maria, I am in London. The weather is rainy.
