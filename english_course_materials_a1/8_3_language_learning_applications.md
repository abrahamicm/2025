## Introduction

Hello! In this lesson, we’re going to talk about language learning applications. These apps can be very helpful for you as an A1 English learner. They can help you practice English in a fun and easy way.

## Explanation

Language learning applications, or apps, are programs you can use on your phone, tablet, or computer to learn English. They often include games, pictures, and sound. Many apps help you learn new words, practice grammar, and improve your listening skills. Some popular applications are Duolingo, Memrise, and Babbel. It’s important to choose an app that you find fun and easy to use. For example, an app might show you a picture of a cat and then ask you to choose the word "cat" from a list. This helps you learn new words by seeing and hearing them. Another example is an app asking "What is your name?" and you can answer using your name.
