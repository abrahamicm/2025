# 1.6. Countries and nationalities (1.6)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about different countries and their nationalities. Knowing this information is very important for introducing yourself and understanding where other people come from. It will also help you talk about travel and different cultures.

## Explanation

Let's talk about what a country and a nationality are. A *country* is a place on the map, like France or Japan. A *nationality* tells you what country a person is from. For example, if someone is from France, their nationality is French. If someone is from Japan, their nationality is Japanese.

We often use the verb "to be" when talking about nationalities. For example, "I am American," or "She is Italian." Sometimes, the country and the nationality have the same name, like "Canada" and "Canadian." Other times, they are different words, like "Germany" and "German."

Here are some important things to remember. We usually capitalize countries and nationalities. We say, "He is from Brazil," not "He is from brazil." Also, we say, "She is Spanish," not "She is spanish."

## Examples

Now, let’s look at some examples. Here are some common phrases and sentences using countries and nationalities:

*   I am from the United States. I am American.
*   He is from the United Kingdom. He is British.
*   She is from Spain. She is Spanish.
*   They are from China. They are Chinese.
*   We are from Germany. We are German.
