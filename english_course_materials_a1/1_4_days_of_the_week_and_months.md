# 1.4. Days of the week and months (1.4)

## Introduction

Learning the days of the week and the months of the year is very important for beginners in English. These words help you talk about time, make plans, and understand schedules. So let's get started!

## Explanation

In this section, we’ll explore the days of the week and the months of the year. The days of the week are seven: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Remember, in English, we always start each day of the week with a capital letter. For example, we write “Monday,” not “monday.”

The months of the year are twelve: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December. Just like the days of the week, we always begin each month with a capital letter. For example, we write “January,” not “january.” Knowing these words helps you talk about when things happen, like your birthday or a holiday. It’s useful to practice saying them out loud.

## Examples

Now, let’s see some examples of how we use the days of the week and the months of the year in sentences.

Here are some useful phrases:

- Today is Monday.
- Tomorrow is Tuesday.
- Yesterday was Sunday.
- My birthday is in June.
- Christmas is in December.

Here are some example sentences:

- I go to school on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
- I like to play football on Saturday and Sunday.
- The weather is usually nice in July.
- We celebrate Easter in April.
- I have English class on Wednesday.
