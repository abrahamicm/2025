# 2.8. Countable and uncountable nouns (2.8)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about countable and uncountable nouns. Understanding the difference between these two types of nouns is very important for speaking and writing correctly in English. It will help you to form correct sentences and be easily understood.

## Explanation

Countable nouns are things we can count. For example, we can count apples. We can have one apple, two apples, three apples, and so on. Because we can count them, countable nouns can be singular or plural. The singular form is used when there is only one. The plural form is used when there are more than one. For example: "I have **an apple**." (singular) and "I have **three apples**." (plural).

Uncountable nouns are things we cannot count as individual items. These are often liquids, like water, or abstract ideas, like love. We cannot say "one water," or "two loves." Uncountable nouns are almost always treated as singular, even if there seems to be a lot of them. We use words like "some," "much," or "a lot of" with uncountable nouns. For example, we can say: "I need **some water**." or "There is **much love** in my family." We do not add an "s" to make them plural.

Now, letâ€™s look at some examples.

## Examples

Here are some useful phrases and sentences that use countable and uncountable nouns.

*   I have **a dog**.
*   I have **two dogs**.
*   She needs **some help**.
*   There is **a lot of sugar** in the coffee.
*   He bought **a new car**.
*   They have **three cars**.
*   We need **some information**.
*   I drank **a glass of water**.
