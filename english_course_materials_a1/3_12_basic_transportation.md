# 3.12. Basic transportation (3.12)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about basic transportation. Knowing about transportation is important for traveling and getting around in your city or town. This will help you communicate when you need to take a bus, train, or other form of transportation.

## Explanation

Transportation refers to how we move from one place to another. There are many different types of transportation. We can walk, ride a bicycle, take a bus, or travel by train. A car is also a common way to travel. Some people also use motorcycles. For longer distances, we often travel by airplane. Let's say you want to go to the store. You might walk if it's close, or you could drive your car. If the store is far away in another city, maybe you'd take an airplane.

## Examples

Now, letâ€™s look at some examples. Here are some useful phrases and sentences about transportation:

*   "I take the bus to school."
*   "She drives her car to work."
*   "We ride our bikes on the weekend."
*   "The train is very fast."
