# 3.8. Parts of the body (3.8)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about the different parts of the body. Knowing the names of body parts is important for understanding simple instructions, describing yourself or others, and talking about health. This is a very useful topic for English learners at the A1 level.

## Explanation

Let's learn about the different parts of our body. We all have a head, which is at the top of our body. On our head, we have hair, eyes, a nose, a mouth, and ears. We use our eyes to see the world around us. We use our nose to smell things. We use our mouth to eat and talk. We use our ears to hear sounds.

Below our head is our neck. Our neck connects our head to our body. Our body has a chest and a stomach. We also have arms, hands, and legs. Our arms have hands at the end, and we use our hands to hold things. Our legs have feet at the end, and we use our feet to walk and run.

Here are some other important parts: We have fingers on our hands and toes on our feet. We have a back that helps us stand up straight. We have shoulders that connect our arms to our body.

## Examples

Now, let's look at some examples of how we use these words in sentences.

- My head hurts.
- I wash my hands before I eat.
- He kicked the ball with his foot.
- She has beautiful eyes.
- My arm is long.

Here are some useful phrases:

- I have two eyes.
