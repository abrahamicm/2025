# 8.1. Vocabulary memorization techniques (8.1)

## Introduction

It's important to learn new words in English, especially when you are a beginner. Learning new words will help you understand more and express yourself better. This lesson will show you some easy ways to remember new vocabulary.

## Explanation

In this section, we’ll explore some techniques that can help you memorize new English words. One simple way is to write down new words in a notebook.  Next to each word, write what it means in your own language.  For example, you could write "happy - contento" if your language is Spanish.

Another technique is to use flashcards. Write the English word on one side and the meaning in your language on the other side. You can carry these with you and practice whenever you have a few free minutes.

Repeating the words out loud also helps. Saying the word and its meaning several times will make it easier to remember.  For instance, practice saying "cat - gato" multiple times.

Finally, try to use the new words in sentences. This will help you understand how they are used and make them stick in your memory.  For example, instead of just remembering "apple," try saying "I like apples."

## Examples

Now, let’s look at some examples of vocabulary and how to memorize them.

- Dog
    I have a dog.
- House
    This is my house.
- Book
    I am reading a book.
- Good
    That is good.
- Friend
    She is my friend.

Here are some useful phrases:

- "What does 'hello' mean?"

- "I don't understand."
- "What is this?"
