# 2.3. Possessive adjectives (my, your, his, her, its, our, their) (2.3)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about possessive adjectives. Understanding possessive adjectives is important because they help us show who owns something. They are very useful for talking about families, friends, and belongings. These words will help you describe things more clearly and talk about ownership in simple sentences.

## Explanation

Possessive adjectives are words that show who or what something belongs to. They come before a noun. Think of them as little signposts that tell you "This thing belongs to *this* person!"

Here are the possessive adjectives we will learn:

*   **My:** This shows something belongs to *me*.
*   **Your:** This shows something belongs to *you*.
*   **His:** This shows something belongs to a *male* person.
*   **Her:** This shows something belongs to a *female* person.
*   **Its:** This shows something belongs to an *object* or *animal*.
*   **Our:** This shows something belongs to *us*.
*   **Their:** This shows something belongs to *them*.

For example, if I have a book, I would say "This is *my* book." If you have a pen, I would say "That is *your* pen." Remember that these words always come *before* the thing they are describing, which is called a noun. So it's "my book" and not "book my."

## Examples

Now, letâ€™s look at some examples of how to use possessive adjectives in sentences.

Here are some useful phrases that often use possessive adjectives:
*   My name is...
*   Your address is...
*   His phone number is...
*   Her favorite color is...
*   Its food is here.
*   Our house is big.
*   Their car is new.

Here are some example sentences:

*   This is *my* dog. *My* dog is small.

*   He likes *his* job. *His* job is interesting.
