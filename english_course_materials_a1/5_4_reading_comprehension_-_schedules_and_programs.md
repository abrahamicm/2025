# 5.4. Reading comprehension - schedules and programs (5.4)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we're going to learn about reading schedules and programs. This is very important for everyday life, like understanding a bus timetable or a TV guide. Learning to understand these simple documents will help you plan your day and find the information you need.

## Explanation

Reading schedules and programs is about understanding when things happen. A schedule tells you the time of events, such as when a bus arrives or when a class starts. A program often tells you what activities are happening at a certain time, like a TV program guide or a list of events at a festival.

For example, imagine you see a schedule that says "Bus 101: 9:00 AM". This means that bus number 101 will arrive at 9:00 in the morning. Or if a program says "Movie: 7:00 PM", it means a movie will start at 7:00 in the evening. Look for keywords like "time," "start," "end," "day," and "date". These words tell you important information in schedules and programs.

## Examples

Now, letâ€™s look at some examples. Here are some useful phrases and sentences to help you understand schedules and programs:

*   "The train leaves at 10:30 AM."
*   "The class starts at 2:00 PM."
*   "The movie begins at 8:00 PM."
*   "The meeting is on Monday at 3:00 PM."
*   "The store opens at 9:00 AM and closes at 6:00 PM."

Here are some other useful words:

*   "AM" - This means morning.
*   "PM" - This means afternoon or evening.
*   "Daily" - This means every day.
*   "Weekly" - This means every week.
