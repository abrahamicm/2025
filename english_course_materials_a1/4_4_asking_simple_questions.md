# 4.4. Asking simple questions (4.4)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we're going to learn how to ask simple questions in English. Asking questions is very important for A1 learners because it helps you to get information and communicate with others. It's a fundamental skill that will unlock many opportunities for you to practice and improve your English.

## Explanation

Asking simple questions is a crucial part of basic communication. At the A1 level, we focus on forming questions that require short and direct answers. The most common question words you'll use are *what*, *where*, *who*, *when*, *how*, and *why*.

We can also form questions using the verb *to be*, like *Is* and *Are*. For example: *Is it cold today?* We can also use auxiliary verbs like *do* or *does* to ask questions about actions. For example: *Do you like coffee?*

Remember to use a rising intonation at the end of your question. This means your voice goes up slightly when you finish the sentence. This helps people understand that you are asking a question.

## Examples

Now, let's look at some examples. Here are some useful phrases and example sentences.

*   **What** is your name?
*   **Where** are you from?
*   **Who** is that?
*   **When** is your birthday?
*   **How** are you?
*   **Why** are you happy?
*   Are you a student?
*   Is it raining?
*   Do you speak English?
*   Does she work here?

Here are some example sentences:

*   What is your favorite color?
*   Where is the library?
*   How old are you?
*   Do you like pizza?
*   Is this your bag?
