# 2.12. Articles - a, an, the (2.12)

## Introduction

Understanding articles like "a," "an," and "the" is very important for beginners in English. Using them correctly will help you speak and write more clearly, so people can understand you easily. This lesson will explain how to use these little words.

## Explanation

In English, we use articles before nouns. Nouns are words that name people, places, things, or ideas. There are two types of articles: indefinite articles ("a" and "an") and the definite article ("the").

We use "a" before nouns that start with a consonant sound. For example, we say "a book," "a car," and "a dog." Remember to listen to the *sound*, not just the letter.

We use "an" before nouns that start with a vowel sound. Vowels are the letters a, e, i, o, and u. For example, we say "an apple," "an egg," and "an orange." Again, listen to the *sound*, as sometimes words like "hour" sound like they start with a vowel.

We use "a" and "an" when we are talking about something in general, or when it's the first time we mention it.

"The" is a definite article. We use "the" when we are talking about something specific, or when we have already mentioned it before. For example, "I saw a cat. The cat was black." We also use "the" with unique things, like "the sun," "the moon," and "the Earth."

## Examples

Now, let's look at some examples. These phrases will help you understand how to use "a," "an," and "the" correctly.

- A book
- An apple
- The sun
- A car
- An orange
- The moon

Here are some useful phrases:

- I have a dog.
- She eats an apple every day.
- The car is red.
- He needs a pen.
- They saw an elephant.
- The Earth is round.

Here are some short example sentences that demonstrate correct usage:
