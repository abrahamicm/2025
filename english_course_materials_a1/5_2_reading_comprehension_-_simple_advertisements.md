# 5.2. Reading comprehension - simple advertisements (5.2)

## Introduction

In this section, we're going to learn about reading simple advertisements. Understanding advertisements is important because they are everywhere. They help us know about new products, special offers, and different services that might be useful to us. Even simple advertisements can give us a lot of information.

## Explanation

Let's understand what an advertisement is. An advertisement, or ad, is a message that tries to make people buy something. It could be a product, like a new toy, or a service, like getting your hair cut. Advertisements use words and pictures to get our attention. They often tell us why we should buy something.

For example, a simple advertisement for a bakery might say "Fresh Bread Daily!" This tells us the bakery sells bread and that the bread is made fresh every day. Another example could be an advertisement for a coffee shop that says, "Best Coffee in Town! Open 7 AM to 7 PM." This tells us that the coffee is very good and when the shop is open. Itâ€™s important to read carefully to understand what the advertisement is trying to say. Knowing these small details can help us find the things we need.

## Examples

Now, let's look at some examples of phrases and words used in simple advertisements.

*   **Sale!** This means the price is lower than usual.
*   **New!** This means the product is recently made or available.
*   **Open Daily.** This means the business is open every day.
*   **Free Delivery.** This means they will bring your order to you without an extra charge.
*   **Best Price!** This means they believe they have the lowest price compared to other places.

Here are some example sentences you might see in advertisements:

*   "Sale! All shoes are 50% off."
*   "New ice cream flavor! Try it today."
