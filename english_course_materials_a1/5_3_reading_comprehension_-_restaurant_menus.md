# 5.3. Reading comprehension - restaurant menus (5.3)

## Introduction

Hello everyone! Today, we are going to learn about reading restaurant menus. This is very important because when you go to a restaurant in an English-speaking country, you need to understand what food and drinks they have. This will help you order what you want and enjoy your meal.

## Explanation

In this section, we'll explore what a restaurant menu is and what kind of information it usually contains. A restaurant menu is a list of all the food and drinks that a restaurant offers to its customers. It usually includes the name of the dish, a short description, and the price.

Menus are usually divided into sections. Common sections include:

*   Appetizers: Small dishes to eat before the main course.
*   Main Courses: The main part of your meal.
*   Desserts: Sweet dishes to eat after the main course.
*   Drinks: Beverages like water, juice, or soda.

For example, a menu might say: "Burger: A beef patty with cheese, lettuce, and tomato. $8". This tells you what a burger is and how much it costs. Pay attention to the description to know exactly what you are ordering. Remember, food menus might also have sections like "Salads" or "Seafood", so look out for those as well!

## Examples

Now, let's look at some examples of words and phrases you might see on a restaurant menu.

Here are some useful phrases:

*   "Today's Special": This is a dish that the restaurant is offering only for that day.
*   "Vegetarian": This means the dish does not contain any meat.
*   "Gluten-free": This means the dish does not contain gluten, which is found in wheat.
*   "Includes": This means the price of the dish includes other items, like a side salad.

Here are some example sentences:

*   "I would like the chicken salad, please."
*   "What is today's special?"
*   "Does the pasta include bread?"
*   "Is there a vegetarian option?"
*   "The soup is gluten-free."
