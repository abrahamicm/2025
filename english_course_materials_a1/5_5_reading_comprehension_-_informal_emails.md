## Explanation

In this section, we will explore what informal emails are. Informal emails are like friendly letters you send to people you know well, such as friends and family. They are not like formal letters you would send to a company or your boss. Informal emails use everyday language, and you can use contractions like "I'm" or "can't". The tone is usually relaxed and friendly.

For example, instead of writing "I am doing well," you can write "I'm doing well." Instead of writing "I hope that you are well," you can write "I hope you're doing well!". These are common phrases in informal emails. Remember to always be polite, even in informal emails.
