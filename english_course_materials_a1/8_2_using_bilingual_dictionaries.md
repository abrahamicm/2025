# 8.2. Using bilingual dictionaries (8.2)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we're going to learn about using bilingual dictionaries. This is very helpful for English learners at the A1 level because it can help you understand new words and express yourself better in English. Using a dictionary can make learning English easier and more fun.

## Explanation

A bilingual dictionary is a special book that helps you find the meaning of words in two different languages. Usually, it's your native language and English. So, if you see an English word you don't know, you can look it up in the dictionary to find its meaning in your own language.

For example, if you see the word "cat," you can look it up in your dictionary. It will tell you what "cat" means in your language. It will probably also tell you that "cat" is an animal.

Using a dictionary is a great way to learn new words and understand them better. You can find bilingual dictionaries online or in bookstores. Remember to choose a dictionary that is good for beginners. This kind of dictionary uses simple language to explain things.

## Examples

Now, let's look at some examples of how you can use a bilingual dictionary. Here are some useful phrases and example sentences:
