# 5.8. Listening comprehension - instructions and directions (5.8)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about listening comprehension, specifically focusing on understanding simple instructions and directions. This is very important for A1 English learners because it will help you understand what people want you to do and how to get to places. It will also help you follow instructions for simple tasks.

## Explanation

Understanding instructions and directions means being able to listen to someone speak and know what they want you to do. Instructions tell you how to do something. Directions tell you how to go somewhere. To understand them, you need to listen carefully for key words and phrases. These words often include verbs (action words) like “turn,” “go,” “put,” or “take.” Pay attention to words that describe *where* something should go or *when* you should do something. For example, if someone says "Put the book on the table," you need to listen for the verb "put" and the location "on the table." Or, if someone says, "Turn left at the corner," you need to listen for the verb "turn" and the direction "left." It's also important to listen for prepositions like "on," "in," "under," "next to," "in front of," and "behind." These words tell you where things are located in relation to each other. Practice listening to simple instructions and directions to improve your understanding!
