## Explanation

Asking for directions is important when you are lost or need help finding a specific location. When asking for directions, be polite. You can start with a greeting like "Hello" or "Excuse me." Then, clearly state where you want to go. You can say, for example, "Excuse me, where is the bank?" or "Hello, how do I get to the park?"

Giving directions means telling someone how to get to a certain place. When giving directions, use simple and clear instructions. Common words used for giving directions include: "go straight," "turn left," "turn right," "next to," "opposite," and "between." For example, you might say, "Go straight and turn left at the corner."
