# 2.2. Personal pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) (2.2)

## Introduction

Learning personal pronouns is very important for beginners. These pronouns help us talk about ourselves and other people easily. They are some of the first words you will learn in English. They are used all the time! So, let's get started!

## Explanation

Personal pronouns are words we use to replace people or things when we talk. They help us avoid repeating names over and over. Imagine if you kept saying "My friend John" every time you talked about John. That would be repetitive! Instead, we can use "he."

Here are the personal pronouns:

*   **I**: This is used to talk about yourself. Example: I am happy.
*   **You**: This is used to talk to someone else. Example: You are my friend.
*   **He**: This is used to talk about a boy or a man. Example: He is tall.
*   **She**: This is used to talk about a girl or a woman. Example: She is a teacher.
*   **It**: This is used to talk about a thing or an animal. Example: It is a dog.
*   **We**: This is used to talk about yourself and other people together. Example: We are a family.
*   **They**: This is used to talk about more than one person, thing, or animal. Example: They are students.

Remember, "I" is always capitalized. It doesn’t matter where it is in the sentence.

## Examples

Now, let’s look at some examples using these pronouns in everyday sentences.

*   I like to read books.
*   You are learning English.
*   He is playing football.
*   She is singing a song.
*   It is raining outside.
*   We are going to the park.
*   They are eating pizza.

Here are some useful phrases with personal pronouns:

*   I am from…
*   You are welcome.
*   He is my brother.
*   She is my sister.
*   It is nice to meet you.
*   We are happy to see you.
