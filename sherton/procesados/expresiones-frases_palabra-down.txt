down and out
en la miseria
down in the dumps
deprimido/a
down on one's luck
de mala racha
down the hatch!
¡salud!
down to earth
centrado, con los pies en la Tierra
down to the wire
hasta el último momento
There were times in my life when I had absolutely nothing, I was
down and out.
Hank's lost his job, that's why he's been
down in the dumps
lately.
Andy's house burned down and she has no insurance. She really is
down on her luck.
Here's a toast to you, Frank!
Down the hatch!
I like Ben, he's a nice, sensible,
down to earth
guy.
Both teams are playing very well, the game can be won by either of them, it'll go
down to the wire.
