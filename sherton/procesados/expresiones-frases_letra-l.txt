last but not least
por último, pero no por eso menos importante
left, right and center
a diestra y siniestra
life is too short
la vida es demasiado corta
like a bat out of hell
como alma que lleva el diablo
like a fish out of the water
como pez fuera del agua
like a lamb to the slaughter
como borrego al matedero
I brought crackers, cheese, butter, and,
last but not least
, strawberry jam.
Lou went nuts and started insulting everybody,
left, right and center
Come on! Let's go out!
Life's too short
to always stay home watching T.V.!
What happened to Tom? I saw him run off
like a bat out of hell
a few minutes ago.
I never fitted in at school. I used to feel
like a fish out of the water
It was clear that Ann didn't want to marry that man. She went into the church
like a lamb to the slaughter
like greased lightning
como un relámpago
like robbing Peter to pay Paul
como desnudar un santo para vestir otro
like looking for a needle in a haystack
como buscar una aguja en un pajar
like ships that pass in the night
como extraños
like shooting fish in a barrel
pan comido
like water off a duck's back
como si oyera llover
Pete realized he had forgotten to fetch the kids from school and he went out
like greased lightning
Don't you think that asking for a loan to pay off your debts is a bit
like robbing Peter to pay Paul
How are we going to find Jo in this crowd? It's
like looking for a needle in a haystack
Luke saw Kim once but yesterday they were
like ships that pass in the night
The others look tired. Winning this race will be
like shooting fish in a barrel
I've learned to ignore her tantrums. Now it's
like water off a duck's back
little white lie
mentira piadosa
long time no see
tanto tiempo sin verte
loud and clear
perfectamente claro
I told my mom I was staying at Jen's tonight, just a
little white lie
...
Hey, Mark! How are you doing?
Long time no see
Yes, dad, I heard what you said. I heard you
loud and clear
