## 2.5. Demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those)

**Introduction: Why learn about "this," "that," "these," and "those"?**

Hello everyone! Today we're going to learn about demonstrative pronouns. These little words – *this, that, these,* and *those* – are super important for pointing things out and making sure people know *exactly* what you're talking about. Imagine trying to order food if you couldn't say "I want *this* sandwich!" See? Important! They help us communicate clearly and directly. Let's get started!

**What are Demonstrative Pronouns?**

Demonstrative pronouns help us point to specific people, places, or things. They show whether something is *near* or *far* from us, and whether it's *singular* (one) or *plural* (more than one). Think of them as your pointing fingers in language!

Here's a simple table to explain them:

| Pronoun | Number    | Distance | Example                                     |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **This**  | Singular  | Near     | *This* is my book. (I'm holding it)     |
| **That**  | Singular  | Far      | *That* is my house. (I'm pointing to it) |
| **These** | Plural    | Near     | *These* are my shoes. (I'm wearing them)  |
| **Those** | Plural    | Far      | *Those* are my friends. (I see them across the street)  |

**Detailed Explanation with Examples**

Let's look at each pronoun more closely:

*   **This (Singular, Near):** Use *this* when talking about ONE thing that is close to you.

    *   *This* apple is delicious! (You're eating the apple)
    *   "What is *this*?" (You're holding something and asking what it is)
    *   *This* is my best friend, Sarah. (You are next to Sarah)

*   **That (Singular, Far):** Use *that* when talking about ONE thing that is further away from you.

    *   *That* car is very fast. (You're pointing to a car)
    *   "What is *that* over there?" (You're pointing to something distant)
    *   *That* sounds like a good idea! (Referring to something someone said)

*   **These (Plural, Near):** Use *these* when talking about MORE THAN ONE thing that are close to you.

    *   *These* cookies are for you. (You are holding the cookies)
    *   "Are *these* your keys?" (You are holding some keys and asking someone)
    *   *These* flowers smell wonderful. (You are smelling flowers nearby)

*   **Those (Plural, Far):** Use *those* when talking about MORE THAN ONE thing that are further away from you.

    *   *Those* birds are flying south. (You're watching birds in the distance)
    *   "Who are *those* people?" (You're pointing to a group of people)
    *   *Those* were the days! (Talking about past events)

**Important Notes:**

*   "Near" and "Far" are relative. They depend on the situation.
*   We sometimes use "this" and "that" on the phone to introduce ourselves: "Hello, *this* is [your name]." Or when receiving a call, "Speaking. *This* is [your name]."
*   "That" can also mean "the one I'm talking about": "The red shirt or the blue shirt? I want *that* one (the blue shirt)."
