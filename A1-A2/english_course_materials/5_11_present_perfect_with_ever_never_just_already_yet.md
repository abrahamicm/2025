### Introduction: Talking About Experiences and Recent Events

Hello everyone! In this lesson, we're going to explore how to use the Present Perfect tense with some very useful adverbs: *ever, never, just, already,* and *yet*. These words help us talk about experiences and things that have happened recently. Learning how to use them correctly will make your English sound much more natural and help you understand native speakers better. Get ready to dive in!

### What is the Present Perfect Tense? (A Quick Reminder)

Before we start, let's quickly remember the Present Perfect tense. It's formed like this:

**have/has + past participle**

*   **I/You/We/They** *have seen*
*   **He/She/It** *has eaten*

We use the Present Perfect to talk about:

*   Experiences in our lives (without saying exactly when they happened).
*   Actions that started in the past and continue to the present.
*   Recent actions that have a connection to the present.

Now, let's add *ever, never, just, already,* and *yet* to the mix!

### 1.  Ever and Never: Talking About Experiences

*   **Ever:**  *Ever* means "at any time in your life."  We mostly use it in questions.

    *   **Have you *ever* been to Italy?** (This means: "At any point in your life, have you visited Italy?")
    *   **Has she *ever* tried sushi?**
    *   **Have they *ever* played tennis?**

*   **Never:** *Never* means "not at any time."  We use it in affirmative (positive) sentences to make a negative statement. (Remember, we don't usually use double negatives in English!)

    *   **I have *never* been to Japan.** (This means: "At no point in my life have I visited Japan.")
    *   **He has *never* seen snow.**
    *   **We have *never* eaten snails!**

**Important Note:**  *Ever* and *never* relate to the *lifetime* of the subject!

### 2. Just and Already: Talking About Recent Events

*   **Just:** *Just* means "a very short time ago."  We put it *between* 'have/has' and the past participle.

    *   **I have *just* finished my homework.** (This means: "I finished my homework a few minutes ago.")
    *   **She has *just* arrived.**
    *   **They have *just* eaten lunch.**

*   **Already:** *Already* means "before now" or "sooner than expected."  We usually put it *between* 'have/has' and the past participle. It can also go at the end of the sentence for emphasis.

    *   **I have *already* seen that movie.** (This means: "I watched that movie before now.")
    *   **He has *already* finished his work.**
    *   **We have eaten dinner *already*.**

### 3. Yet: Talking About Things We Expect to Happen

*   **Yet:** *Yet* means "until now."  We use it in *negative sentences* and *questions* to talk about something we expect to happen. It usually goes at the *end* of the sentence.

    *   **I haven't finished my homework *yet*.** (This means: "I expect to finish my homework soon, but I haven't done it yet.")
    *   **She hasn't arrived *yet*.**
    *   **Have you eaten lunch *yet*?** (This means: "I expect you to eat lunch soon, have you eaten it?")
    *   **Has he called you *yet*?**

**Key Points about 'Yet':**

*   Negative Sentences: something is expected to happen.
*   Questions:  we want to know if something has happened.

### Common Phrases and Vocabulary

Here are some common phrases and vocabulary you might hear with these words:

*   **Have you ever...?** (Used to ask about experiences)
*   **I've never...** (Used to say you haven't done something)
*   **Just now** (Similar meaning to 'just')
*   **Not yet** (A common short answer to "Have you...yet?")
*   **Finally!** (You might say this if someone has *finally* done something you were waiting for)
*   **Since** and **For** (Often used with Present Perfect to show duration - covered in a separate lesson)
