## 5.5. Comparative and Superlative Adjectives

### Introduction

Hello everyone! Today, we're going to learn about **comparative and superlative adjectives**. This might sound complicated, but it's actually quite simple!  We use comparative adjectives to compare two things.  For example, is your dog bigger than my dog? We use superlative adjectives to compare one thing to many.  For example, is your dog the biggest dog in the park? Understanding comparatives and superlatives will help you describe things more precisely and make your English sound more natural.  Let's begin!

### What are Comparative Adjectives?

We use comparative adjectives to show the difference between two things. We usually form them in two ways:

*   **For short adjectives (usually one syllable): add "-er" to the end of the adjective.**

    *   Example: `tall` becomes `taller`
    *   Sentence:  My brother is `taller` than me.
    *   Other Examples:  `short` -> `shorter`, `old` -> `older`, `fast` -> `faster`, `slow` -> `slower`

*   **For longer adjectives (two or more syllables): use "more" before the adjective.**

    *   Example: `expensive` becomes `more expensive`
    *   Sentence: A Ferrari is `more expensive` than a bicycle.
    *   Other Examples:  `beautiful` -> `more beautiful`, `interesting` -> `more interesting`, `difficult` -> `more difficult`

**Important Note:**  Some two-syllable adjectives can take either "-er" or "more". Often, the -er form is used for adjectives ending in -y, -er, -ow, and -le (e.g., `happier`, `cleverer`, `narrower`, `simpler`). However, it's often safer for A1-A2 learners to use "more".

**Spelling Changes:**

*   **If the adjective ends in consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC), double the final consonant before adding "-er".**

    *   Example:  `big` becomes `bigger`
    *   Sentence: An elephant is `bigger` than a cat.
    *   Other Examples: `hot` -> `hotter`, `fat` -> `fatter`, `thin` -> `thinner`

*   **If the adjective ends in "y", change the "y" to "i" before adding "-er".**

    *   Example: `happy` becomes `happier`
    *   Sentence: I am `happier` today than yesterday.
    *   Other Examples: `easy` -> `easier`, `busy` -> `busier`, `funny` -> `funnier`

### What are Superlative Adjectives?

We use superlative adjectives to compare one thing to *many* things. We usually form them in two ways:

*   **For short adjectives (usually one syllable): add "-est" to the end of the adjective and use "the" before the adjective.**

    *   Example: `tall` becomes `the tallest`
    *   Sentence:  My brother is `the tallest` in his class.
    *   Other Examples: `short` -> `the shortest`, `old` -> `the oldest`, `fast` -> `the fastest`, `slow` -> `the slowest`

*   **For longer adjectives (two or more syllables): use "the most" before the adjective.**

    *   Example: `expensive` becomes `the most expensive`
    *   Sentence:  A Bugatti is `the most expensive` car in the world.
    *   Other Examples:  `beautiful` -> `the most beautiful`, `interesting` -> `the most interesting`, `difficult` -> `the most difficult`

**Important Note:**  Similar to comparatives, some two-syllable adjectives can take either "-est" or "the most". Adjectives ending in -y, -er, -ow, and -le (e.g., `happiest`, `cleverest`, `narrowest`, `simplest`) are often shortened using -est.

**Spelling Changes:**

The spelling changes for superlative adjectives are the same as for comparative adjectives:

*   **CVC Rule:** Double the final consonant before adding "-est" (e.g., `big` -> `the biggest`).
*   **"y" Rule:** Change the "y" to "i" before adding "-est" (e.g., `happy` -> `the happiest`).

### Irregular Adjectives

Some adjectives are irregular and don't follow the rules.  You need to memorize these!

*   `good` becomes `better` (comparative) and `the best` (superlative)
*   `bad` becomes `worse` (comparative) and `the worst` (superlative)
*   `far` becomes `farther/further` (comparative) and `the farthest/furthest` (superlative)

    *   Sentence Examples:
        *   My English is `better` than last year.
        *   That was `the worst` movie I have ever seen.
        *   Canada is `farther` than France.

### Common Phrases and Vocabulary

Here are some useful phrases and vocabulary related to comparative and superlative adjectives:

*   **Than:**  Used to compare two things (e.g., "My car is faster *than* yours.")
*   **As...as:** Used to show that two things are equal (e.g., "My car is *as fast as* yours.")
*   **The same as:** Used to show that two things are equal (e.g., "My book is the same as yours.")
*   **More...than:**  Used to show that something is greater or bigger (e.g., "This cake is more delicious than that one.")
*   **Less...than:** Used to show that something is smaller or lower (e.g., "This book is less expensive than that one.")
*   **The least:** Used to show something is smaller or lower than all others (e.g., "This restaurant is the least expensive one in town.")

### Summary

Great job!  Today we learned about comparative and superlative adjectives.  Remember these key points:

*   **Comparative adjectives** compare two things, and we form them with "-er" (for short adjectives) or "more" (for longer adjectives). We often use "than" after the comparative.
*   **Superlative adjectives** compare one thing to many things, and we form them with "-est" (for short adjectives) or "the most" (for longer adjectives). We use "the" before the superlative.
*   Some adjectives are **irregular**, like `good`, `bad`, and `far`.

Keep practicing, and you'll become a pro at using comparative and superlative adjectives!  Good luck!
