# 1.6. Reading Comprehension - Informal Emails

## 1. Introduction: Why Read Informal Emails?

Hi everyone! In this lesson, we're going to learn how to read and understand **informal emails**. Why is this important? Because we often receive emails from friends, family, and colleagues that are written in a more casual, friendly way. Understanding these emails is crucial for staying connected and understanding the information being shared. These emails can be about anything from weekend plans to a quick question about work. So, let's get started!

## 2. What is an Informal Email?

An informal email is a message you send to someone you know well, like a friend or family member. It's usually written in a relaxed and friendly style. It doesn't need to be perfect, and you can use contractions (like "can't" instead of "cannot") and slang (but be careful with slang!).

**Key differences from formal emails:**

*   **Language:** Informal emails use everyday language, contractions, and sometimes even slang. Formal emails use more professional and polite language.
*   **Purpose:** Informal emails are often for personal communication, like making plans or sharing news. Formal emails are usually for business or official purposes.
*   **Structure:** Informal emails are less structured than formal emails. You don't need a formal greeting or closing.

**Example:**

**Informal Email:**

Subject: Weekend Plans!

Hey Sarah,

How's it going?

Just wanted to see if you're free this weekend. I was thinking we could go to the park on Saturday and have a picnic. What do you think?

Let me know!

Cheers,
John

**Formal Email (For comparison):**

Subject: Meeting Request

Dear Ms. Smith,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to request a meeting to discuss the upcoming project. Would you be available sometime next week?

Please let me know your availability.

Sincerely,
John Doe

Notice the difference? The informal email uses words like "Hey," "Cheers," and contractions like "How's it going?" The formal email uses phrases like "Dear Ms. Smith" and "I hope this email finds you well."

## 3. Reading an Informal Email: Tips and Examples

When reading an informal email, focus on understanding the main idea and any specific requests. Here are some tips:

*   **Read the Subject Line:** The subject line gives you a quick idea of what the email is about.
*   **Identify the Sender:** Who sent the email? Do you know them well? This will help you understand their tone.
*   **Look for Key Information:** What is the main point of the email? Are they asking a question? Are they making a suggestion?
*   **Don't Worry About Every Word:** If you don't understand every single word, that's okay! Try to understand the overall meaning.

**Example Email:**

Subject: Catching up soon?

Hi Maria,

Long time no see! How are you doing?

I was thinking about you the other day and wanted to see if you're free to grab coffee sometime next week. I'm free on Tuesday or Thursday afternoons.

It would be great to catch up and hear what you've been up to.

Best,
Lisa

**Understanding the Email:**

*   **Subject:** Catching up soon? This tells us Lisa wants to meet Maria.
*   **Sender:** Lisa, a friend of Maria's.
*   **Key Information:** Lisa wants to meet for coffee next week and is free on Tuesday or Thursday afternoons.
