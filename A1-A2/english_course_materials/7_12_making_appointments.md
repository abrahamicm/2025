## 7.12. Making Appointments: Let's Schedule!

**Introduction:**

Hello everyone! Today we're going to learn about making appointments in English. An appointment is a fixed time to meet someone or do something. Learning how to make appointments is important because it helps us organize our time and see doctors, hairdressers, or meet friends easily. Whether it's a doctor's visit, a haircut, or catching up with a friend, knowing how to schedule it is a valuable skill! Let's start!

**1. Understanding the Basics: Asking for Availability**

When making an appointment, we need to ask about the other person's availability. Here are some simple ways to do this:

*   **"Are you free on [day]?"**  (e.g., "Are you free on Monday?")
*   **"Are you available on [day]?"** (e.g., "Are you available on Tuesday?")
*   **"When are you free to meet?"**
*   **"What days/times are you available?"**
*   **"Is [day and time] good for you?"** (e.g., "Is Thursday at 2 PM good for you?")

**Example:**

*   **You:** "Hi Maria, are you free on Friday?"
*   **Maria:** "Yes, I am. What time?"

**2. Suggesting a Time and Day**

Once you know the other person is available, suggest a time and day:

*   **"How about [day] at [time]?"** (e.g., "How about Wednesday at 10 AM?")
*   **"Let's meet on [day] at [time]."** (e.g., "Let's meet on Saturday at 3 PM.")
*   **"Can we meet on [day] morning/afternoon/evening?"** (e.g., "Can we meet on Monday morning?")
*   **"I was thinking of [day] at [time]."** (e.g., "I was thinking of Thursday at 4 PM.")

**Example:**

*   **You:** "How about Friday at 10 AM?"
*   **Maria:** "10 AM is perfect!"

**3. Confirming the Appointment**

It's very important to confirm the appointment to make sure everyone is clear. Here's how:

*   **"So, we're meeting on [day] at [time]?"** (e.g., "So, we're meeting on Tuesday at 2 PM?")
*   **"Great, see you on [day] at [time]."** (e.g., "Great, see you on Monday at 11 AM.")
*   **"Okay, I've got you down for [day] at [time]."** (e.g., "Okay, I've got you down for Wednesday at 9 AM.")

**Example:**

*   **You:** "So, we're meeting on Friday at 10 AM?"
*   **Maria:** "Yes, that's right. See you then!"

**4. If the Time Doesn't Work:**

Sometimes the suggested time doesn't work for one person. Here's how to respond:

*   **"I'm sorry, I'm busy then. How about [another day/time]?"** (e.g., "I'm sorry, I'm busy then. How about Friday at 2 PM?")
*   **"I can't make it then. Is [another day/time] possible?"** (e.g., "I can't make it then. Is Saturday morning possible?")
*   **"That doesn't work for me. Can we try [different day/time]?"** (e.g., "That doesn't work for me. Can we try Thursday afternoon?")

**Example:**

*   **You:** "How about Friday at 10 AM?"
*   **Maria:** "I'm sorry, I'm busy then. How about Friday at 2 PM?"
