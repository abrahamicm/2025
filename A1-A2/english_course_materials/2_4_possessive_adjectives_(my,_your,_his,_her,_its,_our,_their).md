## 2.4. Possessive adjectives (my, your, his, her, its, our, their)

### Introduction: Why are possessive adjectives important?

Hello everyone! Today, we're going to learn about **possessive adjectives**. What are they? They're words we use to show **ownership** or **belonging**. Think of them as saying "This thing *belongs to* me!" They are used before nouns to tell us *who* or *what* something belongs to. Knowing these words is super important because you'll use them all the time when talking about your things, your family, and everything around you! Let's get started!

### What are Possessive Adjectives?

Possessive adjectives tell us who owns something. They always come **before** a noun. Here's a breakdown:

| Pronoun (Who owns it?) | Possessive Adjective | Example Sentence                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| I                      | **my**                 | This is **my** book.                        |
| You                    | **your**               | Is this **your** pen?                         |
| He                     | **his**                | **His** car is blue.                          |
| She                    | **her**                | **Her** name is Anna.                         |
| It                     | **its**                | The dog wags **its** tail.                     |
| We                     | **our**                | This is **our** house.                       |
| They                   | **their**              | **Their** children are playing outside.        |

**Important Notes:**

*   **No apostrophe!** Unlike possessive nouns (e.g., *John's* car), possessive adjectives *never* use an apostrophe. It's "its" not "it's" (it's = it is).
*   They always come before the noun they modify. You wouldn't say "Book my" you would say "My book".
*   They agree with the **owner**, not the thing being owned. Example: *He* likes *his* new *bike*. (His relates to he, not bike)
