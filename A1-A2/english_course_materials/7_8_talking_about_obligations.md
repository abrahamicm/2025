## 7.8. Talking about obligations

**Introduction**

Understanding and expressing obligations – things we *have to* do or *need to* do – is a very important part of everyday communication. Whether it's rules at school, work tasks, or just things we promise to do, knowing how to talk about obligations in English will help you understand instructions, give instructions, and talk about your responsibilities. This lesson will focus on simple ways to talk about obligations at the A1-A2 level.

**What is an Obligation?**

An obligation is something you *must* do, or something you are *required* to do.  Think of it like a rule, a duty, or a responsibility.

**How to Express Obligations (A1-A2 Level)**

We'll focus on these key phrases:

*   **have to + verb (base form):**  This shows a general obligation, often because of a rule or a situation.
*   **need to + verb (base form):** This shows a necessity. It's often more personal or less strict than "have to."
*   **must + verb (base form):** This expresses a strong obligation, often coming from the speaker. (Note: We often use "have to" more commonly than "must" in modern spoken English, especially at this level.)

**Detailed Explanation with Examples:**

1.  **Have to:**

    *   **Form:** Subject + have to + verb (base form)
    *   **Meaning:**  A general obligation, often due to a rule, law, or another person.
    *   **Examples:**

        *   I **have to** wake up early for work. (It's part of my job)
        *   Students **have to** wear a uniform at school. (It's the school rule)
        *   We **have to** pay the bill by Friday. (It's a deadline)
        *   She **has to** take her medicine every day. (The doctor said so)

    *   **Important Note for 3rd Person Singular (he, she, it):**  Use "has to"
        *   He **has to** study for the exam.
        *   She **has to** clean her room.
        *   It **has to** be charged before you use it.
2.  **Need to:**

    *   **Form:** Subject + need to + verb (base form)
    *   **Meaning:**  Something is necessary. It can be a bit more personal than "have to."
    *   **Examples:**

        *   I **need to** buy some milk. (We don't have any)
        *   We **need to** practice our English. (To improve)
        *   He **needs to** go to the doctor. (He is feeling unwell)
        *   They **need to** finish the project this week. (It's important)

3.  **Must:**

    *   **Form:** Subject + must + verb (base form)
    *   **Meaning:** Strong obligation, often from the speaker, or a very important rule.
    *   **Examples:**

        *   You **must** be quiet in the library. (Important rule)
        *   I **must** remember to call my mother. (Important reminder to myself)
        *   We **must** protect our environment. (Strong belief)

    *   **Important Note:** While "must" is used, learners at this level will encounter and use "have to" much more frequently in general conversation.

**Common Phrases & Vocabulary:**

*   **Rule:** a law or instruction.  Example: "It's a rule. You have to wear a helmet."
*   **Duty:** something you are supposed to do. Example: "It's my duty to help my family."
*   **Responsibility:** something you are in charge of. Example: "Taking care of my pet is my responsibility."
*   **Important:** something that matters a lot. Example: "It's important to study hard."
*   **Necessary:** something you need. Example: "Water is necessary for life."
*   **Obligation:** A duty or commitment. "Paying taxes is an obligation." (A more formal word, but useful to recognise)

**Negative Obligations (Things you *don't* have to do)**

*   **don't have to + verb (base form):**  You are not obligated to do something. It is optional.
*   **doesn't have to + verb (base form):**  (3rd person singular)
*   **don't need to + verb (base form):** You do not need to do something. It is not necessary.
*   **doesn't need to + verb (base form):** (3rd person singular)
*   **mustn't + verb (base form):** You are not allowed to do something. (Strong prohibition. Again, use cautiously at this level - 'can't' is often easier for learners). *Mustn't* implies it is *forbidden*.

**Examples of Negative Obligations:**

*   I **don't have to** work on Sundays. (It's my day off)
*   She **doesn't have to** wear a uniform on Fridays. (Casual Friday!)
*   We **don't need to** buy bread; we have some at home.
*   He **doesn't need to** water the plants; it rained last night.
*   You **mustn't** smoke here. (It is forbidden)
