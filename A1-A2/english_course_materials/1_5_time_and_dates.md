## Telling the Time

### The Basics

*   **O'Clock:** We use "o'clock" for times that are on the hour.
    *   Example: It's 1 o'clock. (1:00)
    *   Example: It's 5 o'clock. (5:00)

*   **Past:** We use "past" to say the minutes *after* the hour.
    *   Example: It's five past one. (1:05)
    *   Example: It's ten past three. (3:10)
    *   Example: It's twenty past two. (2:20)
    *   Example: It's twenty-five past four. (4:25)

*   **Half Past:** "Half past" means 30 minutes after the hour.
    *   Example: It's half past six. (6:30)
    *   Example: It's half past eleven. (11:30)

*   **To:** We use "to" to say the minutes *before* the next hour.
    *   Example: It's ten to two. (1:50)
    *   Example: It's twenty to five. (4:40)
    *   Example: It's five to ten. (9:55)

*   **Quarter Past / Quarter To:** "Quarter" means 15 minutes.
    *   Example: It's quarter past three. (3:15)
    *   Example: It's quarter to eight. (7:45)

### A.M. and P.M.

*   **A.M.** (Ante Meridiem):  From midnight (12:00 AM) to noon (12:00 PM).  Think of it as "before midday".
    *   Example: 7:00 AM is seven o'clock in the morning.
*   **P.M.** (Post Meridiem): From noon (12:00 PM) to midnight (12:00 AM). Think of it as "after midday".
    *   Example: 7:00 PM is seven o'clock in the evening.
