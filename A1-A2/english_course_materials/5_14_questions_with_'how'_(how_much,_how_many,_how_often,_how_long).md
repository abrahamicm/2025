## 5.14. Questions with 'How' (How much, How many, How often, How long)

**Introduction:**

Hello everyone! Welcome to our lesson on asking questions with "How".  Knowing how to use "How much," "How many," "How often," and "How long" is super important for everyday conversations. These questions help us get information about quantities, frequency, and duration.  Learning these will make it much easier to ask for what you need and understand what others are asking you. Let's get started!

**1. How Much:**

We use "How much" to ask about:

*   **Uncountable nouns:** Things you can't easily count as individual items. Think of things like water, money (currency, not individual coins or bills), sugar, time.
*   **Price:**  How expensive something is.

**Examples:**

*   **Uncountable Nouns:**
    *   **How much** water do you drink every day?  (We don't say "one water, two waters")
    *   **How much** sugar do you want in your coffee? (We don't count sugar granules individually)
    *   **How much** time do we have left?
*   **Price:**
    *   **How much** does this book cost?
    *   **How much** is that shirt?

**Important Note:** We often use "How much" with the verb "cost" when talking about the price.

**2. How Many:**

We use "How many" to ask about:

*   **Countable nouns:** Things you *can* count as individual items. Think of things like apples, people, books, cars.  Remember to use the plural form of the noun!

**Examples:**

*   **How many** apples are on the table?
*   **How many** people are in your family?
*   **How many** books did you read last year?
*   **How many** cars do you have?

**3. How Often:**

We use "How often" to ask about:

*   **Frequency:** How many times something happens.  We often use adverbs of frequency (always, sometimes, never) in our answers.

**Examples:**

    *   I go to the cinema **once a month.**
    *   I **often** go to the cinema.
    *   I **never** go to the cinema.

**Common Frequency Adverbs:**

*   **Always:** 100% of the time
*   **Usually/Normally:** Most of the time (around 80-90%)
*   **Often:** Frequently (around 60-70%)
*   **Sometimes:** Occasionally (around 30-50%)
*   **Rarely/Seldom:** Not very often (around 10-20%)
*   **Never:** 0% of the time

**Other ways to talk about frequency:**

*   **Every day/week/month/year**
*   **Once/Twice a day/week/month/year**
*   **Three times a day/week/month/year**
*   **On Mondays/Tuesdays/Wednesdays... (plural form)**

**4. How Long:**

We use "How long" to ask about:

*   **Duration:** The length of time something lasts.
