## 5.2. Past simple tense (was/were, regular verbs, common irregular verbs)

### Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of the Past Simple tense! This tense is super important because it helps you talk about things that happened in the past. Think about telling stories, describing your weekend, or talking about things you did yesterday. The Past Simple is your key to doing all that! This lesson will cover the basic forms using *was/were*, regular verbs, and some common irregular verbs. Letâ€™s get started!

### 1. What is the Past Simple Tense?

The Past Simple tense is used to describe actions or situations that:

*   Started and finished in the past.
*   Happened at a specific time in the past.  This time may be mentioned or understood.

**Examples:**

*   I **watched** a movie last night. (Specific time: last night)
*   She **was** happy to see her friends. (Completed action in the past)
*   They **played** football yesterday afternoon. (Specific time: yesterday afternoon)

### 2. "Was" and "Were" (The Past Simple of "to be")

"Was" and "were" are the past simple forms of the verb "to be." They are used to describe states of being in the past.

**Rules:**

*   **I** / **He** / **She** / **It**  + **was**
*   **You** / **We** / **They** + **were**

**Examples:**

*   I **was** tired yesterday.
*   He **was** a student last year.
*   She **was** at the park.
*   It **was** cold this morning.
*   You **were** late for school.
*   We **were** happy to see you.
*   They **were** at the beach last summer.

**Negative Form:**

*   **was not** (wasn't)
*   **were not** (weren't)

**Examples:**

*   I **wasn't** at home yesterday.
*   They **weren't** happy with the service.

**Questions:**

*   **Was** I / he / she / it ...?
*   **Were** you / we / they ...?

**Examples:**

*   **Was** she tired? Yes, she **was**. / No, she **wasn't**.
*   **Were** they at the party? Yes, they **were**. / No, they **weren't**.

### 3. Regular Verbs

Most verbs in English are regular. To form the past simple of a regular verb, we usually add "-ed" to the base form.

**Rule:**

*   Base form of verb + **-ed**

**Examples:**

*   **walk**  -> **walked** (I walked to school this morning.)
*   **play**  -> **played** (They played tennis yesterday.)
*   **watch** -> **watched** (She watched TV last night.)
*   **talk**  -> **talked** (We talked about the movie.)
*   **like**  -> **liked** (He liked the food.)

**Spelling Rules:**

*   **Verb ending in "e":** Just add "d" (e.g., live -> lived, bake -> baked)
*   **Verb ending in consonant + "y":** Change "y" to "i" and add "ed" (e.g., study -> studied, cry -> cried)
*   **Short verb ending in consonant-vowel-consonant:** Double the last consonant and add "ed" (e.g., stop -> stopped, plan -> planned) *Note: This rule applies mainly to verbs with one syllable.*

**Negative Form (Regular Verbs):**

*   Subject + **did not** (didn't) + base form of the verb

**Examples:**

*   I **didn't watch** TV last night.
*   She **didn't play** the piano.
*   They **didn't walk** to school.

**Questions (Regular Verbs):**

*   **Did** + subject + base form of the verb ...?

**Examples:**

*   **Did** you **watch** the movie? Yes, I did. / No, I didn't.
*   **Did** she **play** tennis? Yes, she did. / No, she didn't.

### 4. Common Irregular Verbs

Irregular verbs don't follow the "-ed" rule. You need to memorize their past simple forms. Here are some common ones:
