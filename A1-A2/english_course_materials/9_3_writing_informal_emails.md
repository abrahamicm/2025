## 9.3. Writing informal emails: Connecting with Friends & Family

### Introduction

Learning how to write informal emails is super important! Why? Because it's the way we stay in touch with friends and family online. It's different from writing emails to your boss or teacher. Informal emails are relaxed and friendly. This lesson will teach you the basic rules and phrases to write great emails to your friends.

### What is an Informal Email?

An informal email is like a friendly letter, but it's sent online. We use them to:

*   Say hello to someone we know well.
*   Share news or stories.
*   Make plans.
*   Ask about their life.
*   Just chat!

Think of it as talking to your friend, but you're writing it down.
