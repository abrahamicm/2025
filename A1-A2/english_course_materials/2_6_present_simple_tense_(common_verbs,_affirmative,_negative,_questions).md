## 2.6. Present Simple Tense (Common Verbs, Affirmative, Negative, Questions)

**Introduction**

Hello learners! Welcome to a crucial part of learning English grammar: the Present Simple Tense!  This tense is used to talk about habits, routines, general truths, and facts. It's one of the first tenses you'll learn and use regularly, so understanding it well is super important for everyday conversations. Let's dive in!

**1. What is the Present Simple Tense?**

The Present Simple tense describes:

*   **Habits and Routines:** Things we do regularly (every day, every week, etc.)
*   **General Truths and Facts:** Things that are always true.
*   **Scheduled Events:** Things that happen according to a schedule (like trains or buses).

**2. Affirmative Sentences (Positive Statements)**

*   **Subject + Verb (base form)**
    *   **I / You / We / They + Verb (base form)**  
        *   Example: I **eat** breakfast every morning.
        *   Example: They **play** football on Sundays.
        *   Example: We **watch** movies at night.
        *   Example: You **study** English.

    *   **He / She / It + Verb + -s / -es**  (***Third person singular - IMPORTANT!***)
        *   Example: He **eats** breakfast every morning.
        *   Example: She **plays** the piano.
        *   Example: It **rains** a lot in April.
        *   Example: My dog **barks** at strangers.

    **Important Notes:**

    *   For most verbs, we simply add "-s" to the base form for he/she/it.
    *   For verbs ending in -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, or -o, we add "-es":
        *   Example:  He **watches** TV.  She **kisses** her baby. It **goes** to sleep. He **fixes** cars.
    *   For verbs ending in consonant + y, we change the "y" to "i" and add "-es":
        *   Example:  He **studies** English. (study -> studies)  She **flies** a kite. (fly -> flies)

**3. Negative Sentences**

*   **Subject + do/does + not + Verb (base form)**

    *   **I / You / We / They + do not (don't) + Verb (base form)**
        *   Example: I **do not (don't)** like coffee.
        *   Example: They **do not (don't)** live in London.
        *   Example: We **do not (don't)** understand the question.
        *   Example: You **do not (don't)** speak Italian.

    *   **He / She / It + does not (doesn't) + Verb (base form)**  (*Notice the verb goes back to the base form!*)
        *   Example: He **does not (doesn't)** eat meat.
        *   Example: She **does not (doesn't)** play basketball.
        *   Example: It **does not (doesn't)** snow in summer.
        *   Example: My cat **does not (doesn't)** drink milk.

    **Important:**  We use "do not" (don't) and "does not" (doesn't) to make sentences negative. After "don't" or "doesn't", the verb is ALWAYS in its base form (no -s/-es).

**4. Question Sentences**

*   **Do/Does + Subject + Verb (base form) + ?**

    *   **Do + I / You / We / They + Verb (base form) + ?**
        *   Example: **Do** you **like** pizza?
        *   Example: **Do** they **work** on weekends?
        *   Example: **Do** we **need** milk?
        *   Example: **Do** I **understand** you?

    *   **Does + He / She / It + Verb (base form) + ?**  (*Again, the verb is in the base form!*)
        *   Example: **Does** he **play** the guitar?
        *   Example: **Does** she **live** here?
        *   Example: **Does** it **rain** a lot?
        *   Example: **Does** your dog **eat** bones?
