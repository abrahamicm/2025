# 1.2 Numbers from 1 to 100

## Introduction

Hello! Welcome to our lesson about numbers from 1 to 100.  Knowing your numbers is very important in English. You will use them every day for things like:

*   Telling the time
*   Shopping (prices)
*   Giving your phone number
*   Counting things
*   Talking about your age

So, let's start learning! This lesson will help you understand and use numbers from 1 to 100 in English.

## Understanding the Numbers

We will break down the numbers into smaller, easier-to-learn groups.

**1. Numbers 1-10**

These are the foundation!  You *must* know these:

*   1: One
*   2: Two
*   3: Three
*   4: Four
*   5: Five
*   6: Six
*   7: Seven
*   8: Eight
*   9: Nine
*   10: Ten

**Practice:** Count from 1 to 10 aloud.  Do it slowly and clearly.

**2. Numbers 11-20**

These numbers are a little different from the others, so pay close attention.

*   11: Eleven
*   12: Twelve
*   13: Thirteen
*   14: Fourteen
*   15: Fifteen
*   16: Sixteen
*   17: Seventeen
*   18: Eighteen
*   19: Nineteen
*   20: Twenty

**Important note:** Notice the "-teen" ending for numbers 13-19.

**Practice:** Count from 11 to 20 aloud.

**3. Tens: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90**

These are the "building blocks" for making numbers from 21 to 99.

*   20: Twenty
*   30: Thirty
*   40: Forty
*   50: Fifty
*   60: Sixty
*   70: Seventy
*   80: Eighty
*   90: Ninety

**Important note:** Notice the "-ty" ending. Be careful to distinguish between "teen" and "ty". For example:  "Thirteen" (13) and "Thirty" (30).

**Practice:** Count by tens from 20 to 90.

**4. Combining Tens and Ones (21-99)**

To make numbers like 21, 32, 45, we combine the tens and ones. We usually use a hyphen (-) between them.

*   21: Twenty-one
*   22: Twenty-two
*   23: Twenty-three
*   24: Twenty-four
*   25: Twenty-five
*   26: Twenty-six
*   27: Twenty-seven
*   28: Twenty-eight
*   29: Twenty-nine
*   30: Thirty
*   31: Thirty-one
*   32: Thirty-two
    ... and so on.

**Example:**  To make the number 67, you say: Sixty-seven

**Practice:**  Try making the following numbers:
*   43
*   58
*   71
*   86
*   99

**5. One Hundred**

*   100: One Hundred

That's it!

## Common Phrases and Vocabulary

Here are some useful phrases that use numbers:

*   **How old are you?** I am *twenty-five* years old.
*   **What's your phone number?** It's *five-five-five*, *one-two-three*, *four-five-six-seven*. (We usually say phone numbers digit by digit)
*   **How much does it cost?** It costs *thirty-five* dollars.
*   **What time is it?** It's *ten* o'clock.  Or it's *quarter past ten* (10:15).
*   **How many?**  There are *fourteen* people in the class.
*   **My address is number twenty-one, Main Street.** (You can also say "twenty one" instead of "twenty-one" for street addresses, but using the hyphen is clearer.)
