## 9.8. Writing about future plans and projects

**Introduction:**

Hello everyone! In this lesson, we're going to learn how to write about our future plans and projects. This is a super useful skill! Imagine telling your friends what you want to do next weekend, or writing a short email about a project you're planning. Knowing how to talk and write about the future makes you a better communicator and helps you achieve your goals! Let's get started!

**1. Understanding the Basics: Talking About the Future**

At the A1-A2 level, we mainly use two simple ways to talk about the future:

*   **"Going to" for plans and intentions:** We use "going to" when we have already made a decision or plan.
*   **"Will" for predictions and spontaneous decisions:** We use "will" when we're making a guess about the future or deciding something right now.

**2. Using "Going to" for Future Plans**

We use the structure: **Subject + am/is/are + going to + verb (base form)**

*   **I am going to** visit my grandmother next Sunday.
*   **She is going to** study English in the library tomorrow.
*   **We are going to** play football in the park this afternoon.
*   **They are going to** have a picnic next weekend.
*   **He is going to** watch a movie tonight.
*   **It is going to** rain, I think. (Sometimes used for a near future prediction based on observation)

**Examples in sentences:**

*   "Next month, I **am going to** travel to London for a week."
*   "My friend **is going to** start a new job next Monday."
*   "We **are going to** eat pizza for dinner tonight."
*   "I **am not going to** work tomorrow. It's my day off!"
*   "**Are** you **going to** watch the football match tonight?"

**3. Using "Will" for Future Predictions and Spontaneous Decisions**

We use the structure: **Subject + will + verb (base form)**

*   **I will** help you with your homework. (Spontaneous decision - decided just now)
*   **She will** probably be late for the meeting. (Prediction)
*   **We will** see you tomorrow. (Promise)
*   **They will** win the game, I think. (Prediction)
*   **He will** call you later. (Promise)
*   **It will** be sunny tomorrow, according to the weather forecast. (Prediction)

**Examples in sentences:**

*   "I think it **will** rain later, so take an umbrella."
*   "I **will** answer the phone. It might be important."
*   "Don't worry, I **will** help you carry those bags."
*   "I **will not** (won't) be at the party. I have other plans."
*   "**Will** you open the window, please? It's hot in here."

**4. Common Phrases and Vocabulary**

Here's a list of useful words and phrases for writing about your future plans:

*   **Next week/month/year:** *I am going to visit my family next week.*
*   **Tomorrow:** *I will go to the supermarket tomorrow.*
*   **This weekend/month/year:** *We are going to go camping this weekend.*
