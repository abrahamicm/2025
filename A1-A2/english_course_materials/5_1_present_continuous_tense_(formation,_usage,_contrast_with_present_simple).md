## 5.1. Present continuous tense (formation, usage, contrast with present simple)

**Introduction:**

Hello everyone! Today, we're going to learn about the Present Continuous tense. It's a super useful tense that we use to talk about things that are happening *right now* or around *now*. Understanding and using the Present Continuous will help you describe what people are doing, talk about temporary situations, and express future plans. So, let's get started!

**1. What is the Present Continuous Tense?**

The Present Continuous tense (also called Present Progressive) describes actions that are happening *at the moment of speaking* or around this time. It’s about things that are *in progress*.

**2. How to Form the Present Continuous Tense:**

The Present Continuous tense is formed using:

*   **am / is / are + verb + -ing**

Let's break it down:

*   **Subject + Auxiliary Verb (am/is/are) + Main Verb + -ing**

**Examples:**

| Subject    | Auxiliary Verb | Main Verb  | -ing Form  | Sentence                              |
|------------|----------------|------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| I          | am             | play       | playing    | I am playing video games.              |
| He/She/It | is             | eat        | eating     | He is eating an apple.                 |
| You/We/They| are            | watch      | watching   | They are watching a movie.             |

**Important notes on adding -ing:**

*   **Most verbs:** Just add -ing.  *Example:  work -> working,  read -> reading*
*   **Verbs ending in -e:**  Remove the -e and add -ing.  *Example:  write -> writing,  dance -> dancing*
    *   **Exception:**  Verbs ending in -ee.  *Example:  see -> seeing*
*   **Short verbs with one syllable ending in consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC):** Double the last consonant and add -ing. *Example:  run -> running,  swim -> swimming*
    *   **Exception:** Verbs ending in -w, -x, -y. Don't double. *Example: show -> showing, fix -> fixing, play -> playing*
*   **Two-syllable verbs where the stress is on the *second* syllable ending in CVC:** Double the last consonant and add -ing. *Example: begin -> beginning, prefer -> preferring*

**3. When to Use the Present Continuous Tense:**

*   **Actions happening *now*, at the moment of speaking:**

    *   Example:  "The baby is sleeping." (Right now, the baby is in the process of sleeping.)
    *   Example:  "I am learning English." (I am in the process of learning English at this time in my life).
*   **Temporary situations:**

    *   Example: "I am living in London for a few months." (This is not permanent; it will change.)
    *   Example: "She is working at a coffee shop this summer." (A temporary job.)
*   **Trends or changing situations:**

    *   Example: "More and more people are using smartphones." (The situation is changing.)
*   **Future arrangements (with a definite time and place - often used at A2 level):** *This use is less common at A1.*

    *   Example: "We are meeting tomorrow at 10 AM." (This is a planned event in the future). *Focus on the 'now' and 'temporary' uses at A1.*

**4. Common Phrases and Vocabulary Related to Present Continuous:**

*   **Right now:**  "What are you doing right now?"
*   **At the moment:** "I am busy at the moment."
*   **Today:** "I am working late today."
*   **Currently:** "The company is currently hiring new employees."
*   **Listen!** (Often used to draw attention to something happening now) "Listen! The birds are singing!"
*   **Look!** (Often used to draw attention to something happening now) "Look! It is raining!"

**5. Present Simple vs. Present Continuous:**

This is VERY important!  They are used for different things:

| Feature          | Present Simple                      | Present Continuous                                 |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Use**          | Habits, routines, general truths, facts | Actions happening now, temporary situations        |
| **Time frame**   | Always, usually, often, sometimes, never| Now, at the moment, today, this week/month/year     |
| **Form**         | Base form of the verb (or -s/-es for he/she/it) | am/is/are + verb + -ing                           |
| **Examples**     | I eat breakfast every day.             | I am eating breakfast right now.                  |
|                   | She works at a bank.                | She is working from home today.                       |
|                   | The sun rises in the east.            | The sun is shining brightly.  (*Right now* it is bright) |

**Think of it this way:**

*   **Present Simple:**  What you *generally* do.
*   **Present Continuous:** What you are doing *at this moment*.
