# 5.10. Present perfect simple (formation with have/has + past participle)

## Introduction

Welcome, English learners! Today, we're diving into a crucial tense: the **Present Perfect Simple**. Don't be intimidated by the name! This tense is all about connecting the past to the present. It's used to talk about things that happened at an unspecified time in the past and are relevant *now*. Understanding this tense will significantly improve your ability to talk about experiences, achievements, and changes. Let's get started!

## What is the Present Perfect Simple?

The Present Perfect Simple tense connects a past action or event to the present. It focuses on the *result* of the action, not necessarily *when* it happened. Think of it as the "so what?" tense.  We don't say *when* something happened, just that it *has* happened, and it has some relevance now.

**Key things to remember:**

*   **Past connected to the present:**  The action happened in the past, but it's still important or relevant *now*.
*   **Unspecified time:** We don't usually say *when* the action happened.
*   **Focus on the result:**  We're interested in the consequence of the action.

## How to Form the Present Perfect Simple

The present perfect simple is formed using:

**Have/Has + Past Participle**

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Have:** Used with I, you, we, they
*   **Has:** Used with he, she, it
*   **Past Participle:** This is the trickiest part!  For regular verbs, it's the same as the simple past (verb + -ed).  For irregular verbs, you'll need to memorize them! (See the table below).

**Examples:**

| Subject Pronoun | Auxiliary Verb | Past Participle (Example: "Eat") | Complete Sentence                                 |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| I               | have           | eaten                             | I **have eaten** breakfast.                       |
| You             | have           | eaten                             | You **have eaten** too much cake!                |
| He              | has            | eaten                             | He **has eaten** all the cookies.                   |
| She             | has            | eaten                             | She **has eaten** her lunch.                        |
| It              | has            | rained                            | It **has rained** all day.                           |
| We              | have           | eaten                             | We **have eaten** dinner already.                   |
| They            | have           | eaten                             | They **have eaten** at that restaurant before.      |

**Regular Verbs:**

The past participle of regular verbs is formed by adding "-ed" to the base form of the verb. Just like the simple past tense.

*   **Play** -> **Played** (I have played football.)
*   **Watch** -> **Watched** (She has watched the movie.)
*   **Walk** -> **Walked** (They have walked to school.)

**Irregular Verbs:**

| say       | said        | said            |
| think     | thought     | thought         |

**Negative Form:**

To make the Present Perfect Simple negative, add "not" after "have" or "has".

*   **Have not** (haven't)
*   **Has not** (hasn't)

**Examples:**

*   I **haven't seen** that movie.
*   He **hasn't finished** his homework yet.
*   We **haven't been** to Italy.

**Question Form:**

To form a question, invert "have/has" and the subject.

*   **Have** I/you/we/they + past participle...?
*   **Has** he/she/it + past participle...?

**Examples:**

*   **Have** you **eaten** dinner?
*   **Has** she **visited** Paris?
*   **Have** they **finished** the project?
