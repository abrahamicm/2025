## 2.7. Third Person Singular (-s): He, She, It & the Present Simple

### Introduction: Why is the -s Important?

Hello learners! Welcome to a crucial part of English grammar: the third person singular. This might sound complicated, but it just means how verbs change when we talk about **he, she, or it** in the present. Getting this right is important because it helps people understand you clearly. It shows you understand basic English grammar and makes your sentences sound more natural. Let's learn how to add that little "-s" correctly!

### What is the Third Person Singular?

In the present simple tense, we usually add an "-s" to the end of the verb when the subject is a singular noun or pronoun in the third person. This means when we're talking about:

*   **He:** A male person (e.g., John, my brother)
*   **She:** A female person (e.g., Mary, my sister)
*   **It:** An object, animal, or place (e.g., the cat, the house, the car)

**Think of it like this: He, She, It, Add an S!**

**Examples:**

*   I **eat** breakfast. (First person singular)
*   You **eat** breakfast. (Second person singular)
*   He **eats** breakfast. (Third person singular - notice the "-s"!)
*   She **eats** breakfast. (Third person singular - notice the "-s"!)
*   It **eats** food. (Third person singular - notice the "-s"!)
*   We **eat** breakfast. (First person plural)
*   You **eat** breakfast. (Second person plural)
*   They **eat** breakfast. (Third person plural)

**More Examples:**

*   I **walk** to school.  She **walks** to school.
*   You **play** football. He **plays** football.
*   We **watch** TV.  It **watches** (only if it's a smart TV and we're being funny!)

### Spelling Rules and Exceptions:

Adding "-s" is usually easy, but sometimes we need to be careful with spelling!

1.  **Most Verbs:** Just add "-s".
    *   Work -> Works
    *   Play -> Plays
    *   Eat -> Eats
    *   Read -> Reads

2.  **Verbs Ending in -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, -o:** Add "-es".
    *   Kiss -> Kisses
    *   Wash -> Washes
    *   Watch -> Watches
    *   Fix -> Fixes
    *   Go -> Goes
    *   Do -> Does

3.  **Verbs Ending in "Consonant + y":** Change the "y" to "i" and add "-es".
    *   Study -> Studies
    *   Cry -> Cries
    *   Try -> Tries
    *   Fly -> Flies

**Important Exception: The verb "have" becomes "has" for he, she, it.**

*   I **have** a car. He **has** a car.
*   You **have** a bike. She **has** a bike.
*   We **have** a dog. It **has** a collar.
