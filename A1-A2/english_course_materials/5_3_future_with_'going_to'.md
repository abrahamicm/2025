## 5.3. Future with 'going to'

### Introduction: Why Learn 'Going to' for the Future?

Learning how to talk about the future is super important in English! We often need to talk about our plans, intentions, and predictions. While there are several ways to talk about the future, the structure "going to" is one of the most common and useful for beginners. It's perfect for expressing **plans and intentions you've already decided on**. This lesson will teach you everything you need to know to use "going to" correctly and confidently.

### Detailed Explanation: How 'Going to' Works

The structure of "going to" is quite simple:

**Subject + *be* (am/is/are) + going to + base form of the verb**

Let's break it down:

*   **Subject:** Who is doing the action? (I, you, he, she, it, we, they)
*   ***be***:  The verb "to be" changes depending on the subject:
    *   **I** *am*
    *   **You** *are*
    *   **He/She/It** *is*
    *   **We** *are*
    *   **They** *are*
*   **going to:** This part is always the same.
*   **base form of the verb:** The simplest form of the verb (without *to*, without -ing, without -ed).  For example: *eat, play, study, watch, go*.

**Examples:**

*   **I am going to eat** pizza for dinner. (Plan)
*   **You are going to study** English tonight. (Intention)
*   **He is going to play** football tomorrow. (Arrangement)
*   **She is going to watch** a movie this weekend. (Plan)
*   **It is going to rain** later. (Prediction based on evidence)
*   **We are going to go** to the beach next summer. (Plan)
*   **They are going to visit** their grandparents. (Intention)

**Negative Form:**

To make a sentence negative, just add "not" after "am/is/are":

**Subject + *be* (am/is/are) + not + going to + base form of the verb**

*   I **am not going to** eat pizza.
*   You **are not going to** study math.
*   He **is not going to** play video games.
*   She **is not going to** watch TV.
*   We **are not going to** travel this year.
*   They **are not going to** buy a new car.

**Question Form:**

To ask a question, simply invert the subject and "am/is/are":

***Be* (Am/Is/Are) + Subject + going to + base form of the verb?**

*   **Am** I **going to** pass the test?
*   **Are** you **going to** visit your family?
*   **Is** he **going to** cook dinner?
*   **Is** she **going to** go to the party?
*   **Are** we **going to** have a picnic?
*   **Are** they **going to** move to a new city?
