## 5.13. First conditional (If + present simple, will + infinitive)

### Introduction: Planning for the Future!

Welcome! The First Conditional is like a magic key that unlocks the ability to talk about **possible future events and their consequences**. We use it to make plans, give warnings, and talk about what might happen if something else happens first. It's essential for basic communication and helps you express future plans and predictions. Get ready to explore the exciting world of "if" and "will"!

### What is the First Conditional?

The first conditional is a grammar structure we use to talk about situations that are **likely** to happen in the future. It describes a possible condition (the "if" part) and a likely result (the "will" part).

**Structure:**

**If + Present Simple, will + infinitive**

*   **If Clause (condition):** *If + subject + verb (present simple)*
*   **Main Clause (result):** *Subject + will + verb (infinitive - base form)*

**Example:**

*   **If** it **rains**, I **will stay** at home.
    *   *If* it rains (condition, present simple)
    *   I *will stay* at home (likely result, will + infinitive)

**Explanation:**

*   **The "if" clause (present simple) describes a possible future situation.**  Think of it as a potential trigger. It's not definite, but it could happen.
*   **The "will" clause (will + infinitive) describes what will probably happen if the "if" clause is true.** It's the likely consequence.

**Order of Clauses:**

The order of the clauses can be switched! If the *if* clause comes second, we **don't** use a comma.

*   I **will stay** at home **if** it **rains**.

### More Examples:

Let's look at some more examples to understand how the first conditional works:

*   **If** I **study** hard, I **will pass** the exam. (Likely result of studying)
*   **If** you **eat** too much candy, you **will feel** sick. (Warning about eating too much candy)
*   **If** we **go** to the beach, we **will swim** in the sea. (Future plan)
*   She **will be** happy **if** he **calls** her. (Result of him calling)
*   They **will miss** the bus **if** they **don't hurry**. (Consequence of not hurrying)

**Negative Forms:**

We can use negative forms in either the *if* clause or the *will* clause.

*   **If** you **don't water** the plants, they **will die**. (*If* clause is negative)
*   **If** I **have** time, I **won't watch** TV. (*Will* clause is negative)

### Common Phrases and Vocabulary:

Here are some helpful words and phrases that often appear in first conditional sentences:

*   **If:** This word introduces the condition.
*   **Will:** Helps us to indicate future events.
*   **Unless:** (If not) - *Unless you hurry, you will be late.* (If you don't hurry, you will be late.)
*   **Happen:** To take place. *If something bad happens, I will call the police.*
*   **Possible:** Able to be done or achieved. *If it's possible, I will visit you.*
*   **Probably:** Likely to happen. *If I go shopping, I will probably buy some milk.*
*   **Maybe:** Perhaps. *If I have time, maybe I will go to the cinema.*
*   **Get:** To receive or obtain. *If I get a good grade, I will be happy.*
*   **Stay:** To remain in a place. *If it rains, I will stay at home.*
