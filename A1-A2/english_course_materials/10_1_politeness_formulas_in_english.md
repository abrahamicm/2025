## 10.1. Politeness Formulas in English: Saying "Please" and "Thank You" (and More!)

### 1. Introduction: Why is Politeness Important?

Hi everyone! Imagine you ask someone for help and they just stare at you blankly. Or you do something nice for someone and they don't even say "thank you." It doesn't feel very good, right?

Being polite helps us communicate effectively and build positive relationships with others. It makes people feel respected and valued. In English, we use special phrases called "politeness formulas" to show good manners. These are simple words and phrases that make a big difference in how we communicate. This lesson will help you learn the most common and important politeness formulas.

### 2. Detailed Explanation with Examples

Politeness formulas are the little words and phrases we use to be respectful and considerate. They're like magic words that can make interactions smoother and more pleasant. Let's explore some of the most common ones:

**2.1. "Please" - The Magic Word!**

"Please" is used when you are asking for something or making a request. It shows that you are not demanding, but politely asking for help.

*   **Examples:**
    *   "Can I have a glass of water, **please**?"
    *   "**Please** close the door."
    *   "**Please** help me with my homework."
    *   "Pass me the salt, **please**."

Notice how "please" can go at the beginning or end of the sentence. Both are correct!

**2.2. "Thank You" (and Variations!)**

"Thank you" is used to show your appreciation when someone does something for you. It's very important to acknowledge their kindness.

*   **Examples:**
    *   "**Thank you** for your help."
    *   "**Thank you** so much!"
    *   "**Thank you** very much!"
    *   "**Thanks**!" (A shorter, more informal version)
    *   "**Thanks a lot!**" (Also informal, but shows a lot of gratitude)

**2.3. "You're Welcome" - Responding to "Thank You"**

When someone says "thank you" to you, it's polite to respond. The most common response is "You're welcome."

*   **Examples:**
    *   Person A: "Thank you for lending me your pen."
    *   Person B: "**You're welcome!**"

    *   Person A: "Thanks!"
    *   Person B: "**You're welcome!**" or "**No problem!**" (More informal)

**2.4. "Excuse Me" - Getting Attention & Apologizing**

"Excuse me" has a couple of different uses:

*   **To get someone's attention politely:**
    *   "**Excuse me**, do you know what time it is?"
    *   "**Excuse me**, is this seat taken?"

*   **To apologize for bumping into someone or interrupting:**
    *   "(After bumping into someone) **Excuse me!**"
    *   "**Excuse me** for interrupting, but..."

**2.5. "Sorry" - Apologizing for Small Mistakes**

"Sorry" is used when you make a small mistake or cause a minor inconvenience.

*   **Examples:**
    *   "**Sorry** I'm late."
    *   "**Sorry**, I didn't mean to step on your foot."
    *   "**Sorry**, I didn't hear you."

**2.6. "Pardon?" / "Sorry?" - Asking Someone to Repeat Themselves**

If you didn't hear or understand something, you can politely ask someone to repeat it using "Pardon?" or "Sorry?".

*   **Example:**
    *   Person A: "I went to the cinema last night."
    *   Person B: "**Pardon?**" (or "**Sorry?**")
    *   Person A: "I said I went to the cinema last night."
