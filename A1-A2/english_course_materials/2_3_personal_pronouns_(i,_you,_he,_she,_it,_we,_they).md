## 2.3. Personal pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they)

**Introduction**

Hello everyone! Today, we're going to learn about something very important in English: **personal pronouns**. Personal pronouns are small words that replace nouns (names of people, places, or things). Learning them will help you speak and write much more easily and naturally! They help us avoid repeating the same nouns again and again. Imagine saying "John went to the store. John bought apples. John came home." It's much better to say "John went to the store. **He** bought apples. **He** came home." Let's dive in!

**What are Personal Pronouns?**

Personal pronouns stand in for nouns. They tell us *who* or *what* we are talking about. Here are the most common ones:

*   **I:** Used to refer to yourself (the speaker).
*   **You:** Used to refer to the person or people you are talking to.
*   **He:** Used to refer to a male person (man, boy).
*   **She:** Used to refer to a female person (woman, girl).
*   **It:** Used to refer to a thing, animal, or place.
*   **We:** Used to refer to a group that includes yourself.
*   **They:** Used to refer to a group of people, things, or animals.

**Detailed Explanation with Examples**

Let's look at each pronoun with some examples:

*   **I:**
    *   **I** am a student.
    *   **I** like to read books.
    *   **I** live in London.

*   **You:**
    *   **You** are a good friend.
    *   **You** speak English very well.
    *   Are **you** hungry?

*   **He:**
    *   John is my brother. **He** is a doctor.
    *   **He** is wearing a blue shirt.
    *   **He** likes to play football.

*   **She:**
    *   Mary is my sister. **She** is a teacher.
    *   **She** is very kind.
    *   **She** enjoys listening to music.

    *   This is my dog. **It** is very friendly.
    *   The book is on the table. **It** is very interesting.
    *   **It** is raining today.

*   **We:**
    *   My friend and I are going to the cinema. **We** are going to watch a movie.

    *   The cats are sleeping. **They** are very tired.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Singular vs. Plural:** *I, you, he, she, it* are singular (referring to one person/thing). *We, they* are plural (referring to more than one person/thing).
*   **Formality:** "You" can be used for one person or multiple people.  English doesn't have a formal "you" like some other languages.
