## 2.8. There is / There are: Talking about What Exists

**Introduction:**

Hello everyone! Today we're going to learn about "There is" and "There are." This is super important because it allows us to talk about what things exist, what we can find in a place, or what is available. It's a fundamental building block for describing the world around us, and you'll use it all the time! So, let's dive in!

**Detailed Explanation:**

We use "There is" and "There are" to say that something exists. Think of it as saying "This exists!" or "These exist!"

*   **There is:** We use "There is" for **singular** nouns. Singular means just **one** thing.

    *   **Example 1:**  **There is** a cat on the roof. (Only one cat)
    *   **Example 2:**  **There is** a book on the table. (Only one book)
    *   **Example 3:**  **There is** some water in the bottle. (Even though "water" seems plural, it's uncountable and treated as singular)

*   **There are:** We use "There are" for **plural** nouns. Plural means **more than one** thing.

    *   **Example 1:** **There are** three birds in the tree. (More than one bird)
    *   **Example 2:** **There are** many students in the classroom. (More than one student)
    *   **Example 3:** **There are** some apples in the basket. (More than one apple)

**Key Differences to Remember:**

|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Noun Type       | Singular          | Plural           |
| Number of Items  | One               | More than one     |
| Examples         | a cat, some water | three birds, many students |

**Negative Forms:**

*   **There isn't:** (There is not) - We use this to say something *doesn't* exist.

    *   **Example 1:** There isn't a dog in the park.
    *   **Example 2:** There isn't any milk in the fridge.

*   **There aren't:** (There are not) - We use this to say multiple things *don't* exist.

    *   **Example 1:** There aren't any chairs in the room.
    *   **Example 2:** There aren't many clouds in the sky.

**Questions:**

*   **Is there...?** - We use this to ask if one thing exists.

    *   **Example 1:** Is there a bank near here? (Yes, there is. / No, there isn't.)
    *   **Example 2:** Is there any coffee left? (Yes, there is. / No, there isn't.)
