11.1. Vocabulary Memorization Techniques for English Language Learners (A1-A2)

Introduction: Why is Vocabulary Important?

Learning new words is like building a house. Each word is a brick. The more bricks you have, the bigger and stronger your house (your English language ability) becomes! Having a good vocabulary helps you:

   Understand more: You can understand what people are saying or writing.
   Speak and write better: You can express yourself clearly and effectively.
   Feel more confident: You won't feel lost when you hear or see new words.

But learning new words can be tricky. How can we remember them? This lesson will teach you some easy and fun ways to memorize vocabulary!

Techniques for Memorizing Vocabulary

Here are some techniques that can help you remember new words:

2.1. Using Flashcards:

   What are they? Small cards with the new word on one side and its meaning (and maybe a picture) on the other.
   How to use them:
       Write the English word on one side.
       Write the meaning in your native language (or a simple English definition) on the other side.
       You can also draw a picture or find an image online and print it.
       Look at the English word, try to remember the meaning. Then, flip the card to check.
       Repeat this process until you remember the word easily.
   Example:

       Front: HAPPY
       Back: (Meaning in your native language) / Feeling good and pleased.  :) (Drawing of a smiling face)

2.2. Using Mnemonics (Memory Tricks):

   What are they?  Using associations, rhymes, or stories to connect the new word with something you already know.
   How to use them:
       Find something that sounds similar to the new word.
       Create a silly sentence or story that connects the word with its meaning.
   Example:

       Word: BIG
       Mnemonic: "A big pig is very big." (You can imagine a large pig).

2.3. Learning Words in Context (Using Sentences):

   What is it? Learning new words by seeing them used in sentences.
   How to use it:
       Find example sentences for the new word in a dictionary or online.
       Read the sentences carefully and try to understand how the word is used.
       Write your own sentences using the new word.
   Example:

       Word: SMALL
       Sentence: "My house is small, but it's comfortable."
       Your Sentence: "I have a small dog."

2.4. Using Pictures and Visuals:

   What is it? Connecting new words with images to help you remember them.
   How to use it:
       Find pictures online that represent the word.
       Draw your own pictures.
       Use different colors to make the images more memorable.
   Example:

       Word: APPLE
       Visual: Draw or find a picture of a red apple.

2.5. Repetition and Review:

   What is it? Regularly going back to the words you've already learned to make sure you don't forget them.
   How to use it:
       Set aside time each day or week to review your vocabulary flashcards or notes.
       Use the words you've learned in conversations or writing.
       Try to find the words in books, movies, or songs.
   Example:

       Review your flashcards every morning for 5 minutes.

2.6. Using Vocabulary Apps and Websites:

   What are they? Digital tools specifically designed to help you learn and practice vocabulary.
   How to use them:
       Download a vocabulary app or visit a website.
       Follow the instructions to learn new words and complete exercises.
       Many apps use gamification to make learning fun.
   Examples: Duolingo, Memrise, Quizlet
