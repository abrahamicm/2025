5.17. Verbs followed by gerund (-ing)

Introduction: Why is this important?

Hi everyone! Welcome to today's lesson.  Have you ever wondered why we sometimes say "I enjoy swimming" instead of "I enjoy to swim"? That's because some verbs in English are always followed by a special verb form called the gerund. The gerund is simply the verb with an "-ing" ending (e.g., swimming, reading, eating).

Understanding which verbs are followed by gerunds is crucial for speaking and writing correct English.  Using the wrong form can make your sentences sound awkward or even confusing. Don't worry, we'll make it easy! Let's dive in!

What are Gerunds?

A gerund is a verb acting as a noun. It always ends in "-ing". Think of it like this:

   Verb: Swim (action)
   Gerund: Swimming (the activity of swimming)

Gerunds can be the subject of a sentence:

   Swimming is fun.

Or the object of a verb (this is what we'll focus on today!):

   I enjoy swimming.

Verbs Followed by Gerunds: The Basics

Many verbs are followed by a gerund (-ing form). Here are some of the most common ones you'll use as a beginner:

   Enjoy: I enjoy reading books.
   Like:  She likes dancing.
   Dislike: He dislikes washing the dishes.
   Hate: We hate waiting in long lines.
   Love: They love singing.
   Stop:  He stopped smoking last year. (This means he quit smoking)
   Start: It started raining.
   Finish: I finished eating.
   Keep (on): She keeps (on) talking. (This means she continues to talk)
   Practice: I practice playing the guitar every day.
   Suggest: I suggest going to the park.
   Consider: I am considering moving to a new city.
   Avoid: You should avoid eating too much sugar.

Important: Notice the pattern? After these verbs, we use the "-ing" form of the next verb.

Examples in sentences:

   I enjoy playing football.
   She loves watching movies.
   They dislike cleaning their room.
   He stopped eating candy.
   We started learning English.
   She finishes studying at 5 PM.

   He considers traveling next year.
   We avoid being late.
