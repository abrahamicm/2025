5.5. Comparative and Superlative Adjectives

Introduction

Hello everyone! Today, we're going to learn about comparative and superlative adjectives. This might sound complicated, but it's actually quite simple!  We use comparative adjectives to compare two things.  For example, is your dog bigger than my dog? We use superlative adjectives to compare one thing to many.  For example, is your dog the biggest dog in the park? Understanding comparatives and superlatives will help you describe things more precisely and make your English sound more natural.  Let's begin!

What are Comparative Adjectives?

We use comparative adjectives to show the difference between two things. We usually form them in two ways:

   For short adjectives (usually one syllable): add "-er" to the end of the adjective.

       Example: tall becomes taller
       Sentence:  My brother is taller than me.
       Other Examples:  short -> shorter, old -> older, fast -> faster, slow -> slower

   For longer adjectives (two or more syllables): use "more" before the adjective.

       Example: expensive becomes more expensive
       Sentence: A Ferrari is more expensive than a bicycle.
       Other Examples:  beautiful -> more beautiful, interesting -> more interesting, difficult -> more difficult

Important Note:  Some two-syllable adjectives can take either "-er" or "more". Often, the -er form is used for adjectives ending in -y, -er, -ow, and -le (e.g., happier, cleverer, narrower, simpler). However, it's often safer for A1-A2 learners to use "more".

Spelling Changes:

   If the adjective ends in consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC), double the final consonant before adding "-er".

       Example:  big becomes bigger
       Sentence: An elephant is bigger than a cat.
       Other Examples: hot -> hotter, fat -> fatter, thin -> thinner

   If the adjective ends in "y", change the "y" to "i" before adding "-er".

       Example: happy becomes happier
       Sentence: I am happier today than yesterday.
       Other Examples: easy -> easier, busy -> busier, funny -> funnier

What are Superlative Adjectives?

We use superlative adjectives to compare one thing to many things. We usually form them in two ways:

   For short adjectives (usually one syllable): add "-est" to the end of the adjective and use "the" before the adjective.

       Example: tall becomes the tallest
       Sentence:  My brother is the tallest in his class.
       Other Examples: short -> the shortest, old -> the oldest, fast -> the fastest, slow -> the slowest

   For longer adjectives (two or more syllables): use "the most" before the adjective.

       Example: expensive becomes the most expensive
       Sentence:  A Bugatti is the most expensive car in the world.
       Other Examples:  beautiful -> the most beautiful, interesting -> the most interesting, difficult -> the most difficult

Important Note:  Similar to comparatives, some two-syllable adjectives can take either "-est" or "the most". Adjectives ending in -y, -er, -ow, and -le (e.g., happiest, cleverest, narrowest, simplest) are often shortened using -est.

Spelling Changes:

The spelling changes for superlative adjectives are the same as for comparative adjectives:

   CVC Rule: Double the final consonant before adding "-est" (e.g., big -> the biggest).
   "y" Rule: Change the "y" to "i" before adding "-est" (e.g., happy -> the happiest).

Irregular Adjectives

Some adjectives are irregular and don't follow the rules.  You need to memorize these!

   good becomes better (comparative) and the best (superlative)
   bad becomes worse (comparative) and the worst (superlative)
   far becomes farther/further (comparative) and the farthest/furthest (superlative)

       Sentence Examples:
           My English is better than last year.
           That was the worst movie I have ever seen.
           Canada is farther than France.

   Than:  Used to compare two things (e.g., "My car is faster than yours.")
   As...as: Used to show that two things are equal (e.g., "My car is as fast as yours.")

Summary

Great job!  Today we learned about comparative and superlative adjectives.  Remember these key points:

   Comparative adjectives compare two things, and we form them with "-er" (for short adjectives) or "more" (for longer adjectives). We often use "than" after the comparative.
   Superlative adjectives compare one thing to many things, and we form them with "-est" (for short adjectives) or "the most" (for longer adjectives). We use "the" before the superlative.
   Some adjectives are irregular, like good, bad, and far.

Keep practicing, and you'll become a pro at using comparative and superlative adjectives!  Good luck!
