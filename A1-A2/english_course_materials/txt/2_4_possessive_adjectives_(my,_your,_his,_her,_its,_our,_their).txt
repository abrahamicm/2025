2.4. Possessive adjectives (my, your, his, her, its, our, their)

Introduction: Why are possessive adjectives important?

Hello everyone! Today, we're going to learn about possessive adjectives. What are they? They're words we use to show ownership or belonging. Think of them as saying "This thing belongs to me!" They are used before nouns to tell us who or what something belongs to. Knowing these words is super important because you'll use them all the time when talking about your things, your family, and everything around you! Let's get started!

What are Possessive Adjectives?

Possessive adjectives tell us who owns something. They always come before a noun. Here's a breakdown:

| Pronoun (Who owns it?) | Possessive Adjective | Example Sentence                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| I                      | my                 | This is my book.                        |
| You                    | your               | Is this your pen?                         |
| He                     | his                | His car is blue.                          |
| She                    | her                | Her name is Anna.                         |
| It                     | its                | The dog wags its tail.                     |
| We                     | our                | This is our house.                       |
| They                   | their              | Their children are playing outside.        |

Important Notes:

   No apostrophe! Unlike possessive nouns (e.g., John's car), possessive adjectives never use an apostrophe. It's "its" not "it's" (it's = it is).
   They always come before the noun they modify. You wouldn't say "Book my" you would say "My book".
   They agree with the owner, not the thing being owned. Example: He likes his new bike. (His relates to he, not bike)
