5.2. Past simple tense (was/were, regular verbs, common irregular verbs)

Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of the Past Simple tense! This tense is super important because it helps you talk about things that happened in the past. Think about telling stories, describing your weekend, or talking about things you did yesterday. The Past Simple is your key to doing all that! This lesson will cover the basic forms using was/were, regular verbs, and some common irregular verbs. Letâ€™s get started!

What is the Past Simple Tense?

The Past Simple tense is used to describe actions or situations that:

   Started and finished in the past.
   Happened at a specific time in the past.  This time may be mentioned or understood.

Examples:

   I watched a movie last night. (Specific time: last night)
   She was happy to see her friends. (Completed action in the past)
   They played football yesterday afternoon. (Specific time: yesterday afternoon)

"Was" and "Were" (The Past Simple of "to be")

"Was" and "were" are the past simple forms of the verb "to be." They are used to describe states of being in the past.

Rules:

   I / He / She / It  + was
   You / We / They + were

Examples:

   I was tired yesterday.
   He was a student last year.
   She was at the park.
   It was cold this morning.
   You were late for school.
   We were happy to see you.
   They were at the beach last summer.

Negative Form:

   was not (wasn't)
   were not (weren't)

Examples:

   I wasn't at home yesterday.
   They weren't happy with the service.

Questions:

   Was I / he / she / it ...?
   Were you / we / they ...?

Examples:

   Was she tired? Yes, she was. / No, she wasn't.
   Were they at the party? Yes, they were. / No, they weren't.

Regular Verbs

Most verbs in English are regular. To form the past simple of a regular verb, we usually add "-ed" to the base form.

Rule:

   Base form of verb + -ed

Examples:

   walk  -> walked (I walked to school this morning.)
   play  -> played (They played tennis yesterday.)
   watch -> watched (She watched TV last night.)
   talk  -> talked (We talked about the movie.)
   like  -> liked (He liked the food.)

Spelling Rules:

   Verb ending in "e": Just add "d" (e.g., live -> lived, bake -> baked)
   Verb ending in consonant + "y": Change "y" to "i" and add "ed" (e.g., study -> studied, cry -> cried)
   Short verb ending in consonant-vowel-consonant: Double the last consonant and add "ed" (e.g., stop -> stopped, plan -> planned) Note: This rule applies mainly to verbs with one syllable.

Negative Form (Regular Verbs):

   Subject + did not (didn't) + base form of the verb

Examples:

   I didn't watch TV last night.
   She didn't play the piano.
   They didn't walk to school.

Questions (Regular Verbs):

   Did + subject + base form of the verb ...?

Examples:

   Did you watch the movie? Yes, I did. / No, I didn't.
   Did she play tennis? Yes, she did. / No, she didn't.

Common Irregular Verbs

Irregular verbs don't follow the "-ed" rule. You need to memorize their past simple forms. Here are some common ones:
