7.3. Making and Responding to Invitations

Introduction

Learning how to make and respond to invitations is a fundamental skill in English. It helps you connect with people, make friends, and participate in social activities. This lesson will teach you simple phrases and strategies for inviting someone to an event or activity, and for accepting or declining an invitation politely. Let's get started!

Making Invitations

Making an invitation means asking someone to join you for something. At A1-A2 level, we use simple questions and statements.

Simple Questions:

   "Do you want to...?" (Very common and versatile)
       Example: "Do you want to go to the park with me?"
   "Would you like to...?" (Slightly more polite than "Do you want to...")
       Example: "Would you like to have coffee with me?"
   "Are you free...?" (Checking availability)
       Example: "Are you free on Saturday?"
       Follow up: "Are you free on Saturday? We could go to the cinema."

Simple Statements:

   "Let's...!" (A suggestion, often followed by an invitation)
       Example: "Let's watch a movie! Do you want to come to my house?"
   "How about...?" (Suggesting an activity)
       Example: "How about going for a walk?"

Important Information to Include:

When you invite someone, be clear about:

   What: What are you inviting them to do? (e.g., "go to the cinema", "have dinner", "play football")
   When: When is the event? (e.g., "tomorrow", "on Saturday", "at 7 pm")
   Where: Where will the event take place? (e.g., "at my house", "at the park", "at the restaurant")

Example Invitation:

"Hi Maria, do you want to go to the cinema with me on Friday at 7 pm? It's at the ABC Cinema."

Responding to Invitations

Responding to an invitation means saying whether you can or cannot accept the invitation. It's important to be polite, regardless of your decision.

Accepting an Invitation:

   Enthusiastic Acceptance:
       "Yes, I'd love to!"
       "That sounds great!"
       "Yes, that's a great idea!"
   Simple Acceptance:
       "Yes, thank you!"
       "Okay, great!"
       "I'd like that very much."

Declining an Invitation:

It's important to give a reason (even a simple one) and to be polite when declining.

   Polite Refusal with a Reason:
       "I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy on Saturday."
       "Thank you for the invitation, but I have other plans."
       "I'd love to, but I have to work."
   Expressing Regret:
       "I wish I could, but..."
       "That sounds fun, but..."

Important: Always thank the person for inviting you, even if you decline.

Example Responses:

   Invitation: "Do you want to have dinner with me tomorrow night?"
       Accepting: "Yes, I'd love to! What time?"
       Declining: "Thank you for the invitation, but I have to study tomorrow night. Maybe another time?"

   Invitation: invitation, invite, event, activity, plan, free
   Accepting: yes, sure, great, sounds good, love to, okay
   Declining: no, sorry, busy, can't, perhaps, maybe next time, another time
