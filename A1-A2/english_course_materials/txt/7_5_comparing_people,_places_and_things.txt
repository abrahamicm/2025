7.5. Comparing people, places and things

Introduction: Why is Comparison Important?

Learning to compare people, places, and things is a vital skill in English. It allows you to:

   Express your opinions and preferences: "I like this apple more than that one."
   Describe differences and similarities: "Sarah is taller than Tom, but they are both good at sports."
   Understand and interpret information: "This city is bigger than my hometown."

This lesson will teach you the basic grammar and vocabulary needed to make simple comparisons. Let's begin!

Comparing Adjectives

We often use adjectives (words that describe nouns) when comparing. Here's how to do it:

A. Short Adjectives (1 or 2 syllables, usually ending in -y)

   Add "-er" to the adjective to compare two things.
   Use "than" after the adjective.

    Example:

       Adjective: Tall
       Sentence: Tom is taller than Sarah.
       Adjective: Cheap
       Sentence: This shirt is cheaper than that shirt.
       Adjective: Happy (becomes happier)
       Sentence: I am happier than yesterday.

Important Spelling Rules:

   If the adjective ends in a consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) pattern, double the last consonant before adding "-er".
       Big -> Bigger
       Hot -> Hotter
   If the adjective ends in "y," change the "y" to "i" before adding "-er."
       Happy -> Happier
       Easy -> Easier

B. Long Adjectives (2 or more syllables)

   Use "more" before the adjective to compare two things.
   Use "than" after the adjective.

    Example:

       Adjective: Expensive
       Sentence: This car is more expensive than that car.
       Adjective: Interesting
       Sentence: This book is more interesting than that book.
       Adjective: Beautiful
       Sentence: She is more beautiful than her sister.

C. Irregular Adjectives

Some adjectives are irregular and don't follow these rules. The most common are:

   Good -> Better
       Example: My English is better than it was last year.
   Bad -> Worse
       Example: The weather today is worse than yesterday.
   Far -> Farther / Further
       Example: My house is farther from school than yours. (Farther for distance, Further for more figurative distance)

Using "As...As" for Similarity

Sometimes we want to show that two things are similar. We use the structure "as + adjective + as."

   Example:

       My brother is as tall as my father. (They are the same height)
       This book is as interesting as the movie. (They are equally interesting)
       The red car is as fast as the blue car. (They are the same speed)

We can also use "not as...as" to show something is less than something else.

   Example:

       My brother is not as tall as my father. (My brother is shorter)
       This book is not as interesting as the movie. (The book is less interesting)
       The red car is not as fast as the blue car. (The red car is slower)

Common Phrases and Vocabulary

Here's some useful vocabulary for making comparisons:

   Similar: Having things in common.  "These two pictures are similar."
   Different: Not the same. "Those two cars are different colors."
   The same as: Exactly alike. "Your shirt is the same as mine!"
   Bigger than: Larger in size. "An elephant is bigger than a cat."
   Smaller than: Less large in size. "A mouse is smaller than a dog."
   More expensive than: Costs more money. "A car is more expensive than a bicycle."
   Less expensive than: Costs less money. "A banana is less expensive than an apple."
   Better than: Of a higher quality. "This coffee is better than that one."
   Worse than: Of a lower quality. "The weather today is worse than yesterday."
   Equally: In the same way or to the same degree. "The players are equally skilled."
