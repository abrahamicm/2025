9.8. Writing about future plans and projects

Introduction:

Hello everyone! In this lesson, we're going to learn how to write about our future plans and projects. This is a super useful skill! Imagine telling your friends what you want to do next weekend, or writing a short email about a project you're planning. Knowing how to talk and write about the future makes you a better communicator and helps you achieve your goals! Let's get started!

Understanding the Basics: Talking About the Future

At the A1-A2 level, we mainly use two simple ways to talk about the future:

   "Going to" for plans and intentions: We use "going to" when we have already made a decision or plan.
   "Will" for predictions and spontaneous decisions: We use "will" when we're making a guess about the future or deciding something right now.

Using "Going to" for Future Plans

We use the structure: Subject + am/is/are + going to + verb (base form)

   I am going to visit my grandmother next Sunday.
   She is going to study English in the library tomorrow.
   We are going to play football in the park this afternoon.
   They are going to have a picnic next weekend.
   He is going to watch a movie tonight.
   It is going to rain, I think. (Sometimes used for a near future prediction based on observation)

Examples in sentences:

   "Next month, I am going to travel to London for a week."
   "My friend is going to start a new job next Monday."
   "We are going to eat pizza for dinner tonight."
   "I am not going to work tomorrow. It's my day off!"
   "Are you going to watch the football match tonight?"

Using "Will" for Future Predictions and Spontaneous Decisions

We use the structure: Subject + will + verb (base form)

   I will help you with your homework. (Spontaneous decision - decided just now)
   She will probably be late for the meeting. (Prediction)
   We will see you tomorrow. (Promise)
   They will win the game, I think. (Prediction)
   He will call you later. (Promise)
   It will be sunny tomorrow, according to the weather forecast. (Prediction)

Examples in sentences:

   "I think it will rain later, so take an umbrella."
   "I will answer the phone. It might be important."
   "Don't worry, I will help you carry those bags."
   "I will not (won't) be at the party. I have other plans."
   "Will you open the window, please? It's hot in here."
