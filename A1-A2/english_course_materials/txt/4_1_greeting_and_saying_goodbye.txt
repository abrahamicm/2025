It helps you be polite and friendly. In this lesson, we will learn some common greetings and farewells that you can use in everyday situations. Let's get started!

Detailed Explanation with Examples

A. Greetings (Saying Hello)

Greetings depend on the time of day and the level of formality needed.

   Formal Greetings: These are used with people you don't know well, or in professional situations.

       "Good morning":  Used from sunrise to noon (12:00 PM).
           Example: "Good morning, Mr. Smith. How are you?"
       "Good afternoon": Used from noon (12:00 PM) to sunset (around 6:00 PM).
           Example: "Good afternoon, class. Please open your books."
       "Good evening":  Used from sunset (around 6:00 PM) onwards.
           Example: "Good evening, Madam. Welcome to the restaurant."
       "How do you do?": This is a very formal greeting, often used when you are first introduced to someone.  The correct response is also "How do you do?".
           Example: "Hello, I'm Sarah. How do you do?"  "How do you do? I'm John."

   Informal Greetings: These are used with friends, family, and people you know well.

       "Hello": A general greeting, suitable for almost any situation.
           Example: "Hello, Mary! How are you doing?"
       "Hi":  A more casual version of "Hello".
           Example: "Hi, David! What's up?"
       "Hey": Very informal, used with close friends.  Be careful using it with people you don't know!
           Example: "Hey, Anna! Long time no see!"
       "How are you?":  A general question asking about someone's well-being. The common response is "I'm fine, thank you. And you?".
           Example: "Hello, how are you?" "I'm fine, thank you. And you?" "I'm good, thanks."
       "How's it going?" / "How's everything?":  Another informal way to ask how someone is doing. Common responses are "It's going well" or "Everything's fine."
           Example: "Hi, Mark! How's it going?" "It's going well, thanks."
       "What's up?":  A very informal way to say "Hello" and ask what's happening. The common response is "Not much" or "Nothing much."
           Example: "Hey John! What's up?" "Not much, just relaxing."

B. Farewells (Saying Goodbye)

Farewells are ways to say goodbye.  Like greetings, they can be formal or informal.

   Formal Farewells:

       "Goodbye": A standard farewell, suitable for most situations.
           Example: "Goodbye, Mr. Johnson. Have a nice day."
       "Good night": Used when someone is going to bed or when you are leaving a place late in the evening.
           Example: "Good night, everyone. See you tomorrow."

   Informal Farewells:

       "Bye": A shorter version of "Goodbye."
           Example: "Bye, Sarah! See you later!"
       "See you later" / "See you soon": Implying you will meet again.
           Example: "Bye! See you later!"
       "Talk to you later":  Similar to "See you later," often used on the phone or online.
           Example: "Okay, I have to go. Talk to you later!"
       "Have a good day/night/weekend": A nice way to end a conversation.
           Example: "It was nice talking to you. Have a good day!"
       "Take care": Showing concern for the other person.
           Example: "Goodbye, take care!"
       "So long": An older, less common, but still understood farewell.
           Example: "So long, partner!"
