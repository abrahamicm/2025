5.7. Prepositions of Movement (to, from, across, through)

Introduction: Why are these prepositions important?

Hello everyone! Today, we're going to learn about some very important words called prepositions of movement.

Understanding these prepositions, especially to, from, across, and through, will make your English much clearer and easier to understand. Imagine trying to explain where you're going without these words!

These prepositions tell us about the direction and path of movement. Knowing them will help you:
