Introduction: Why Learn 'Going to' for the Future?

Learning how to talk about the future is super important in English! We often need to talk about our plans, intentions, and predictions. While there are several ways to talk about the future, the structure "going to" is one of the most common and useful for beginners. It's perfect for expressing plans and intentions you've already decided on. This lesson will teach you everything you need to know to use "going to" correctly and confidently.

Detailed Explanation: How 'Going to' Works

The structure of "going to" is quite simple:

Subject + be (am/is/are) + going to + base form of the verb

Let's break it down:

   Subject: Who is doing the action? (I, you, he, she, it, we, they)
   *be:  The verb "to be" changes depending on the subject:
       I am
       You are
       He/She/It is
       We are
       They are
   going to: This part is always the same.
   base form of the verb: The simplest form of the verb (without to, without -ing, without -ed).  For example: eat, play, study, watch, go.

Examples:

   I am going to eat pizza for dinner. (Plan)
   You are going to study English tonight. (Intention)
   He is going to play football tomorrow. (Arrangement)
   She is going to watch a movie this weekend. (Plan)
   It is going to rain later. (Prediction based on evidence)
   We are going to go to the beach next summer. (Plan)
   They are going to visit their grandparents. (Intention)

Negative Form:

To make a sentence negative, just add "not" after "am/is/are":

Subject + be (am/is/are) + not + going to + base form of the verb

   I am not going to eat pizza.
   You are not going to study math.
   He is not going to play video games.
   She is not going to watch TV.
   We are not going to travel this year.
   They are not going to buy a new car.

Question Form:

To ask a question, simply invert the subject and "am/is/are":

Be (Am/Is/Are) + Subject + going to + base form of the verb?

   Am I going to pass the test?
   Are you going to visit your family?
   Is he going to cook dinner?
   Is she going to go to the party?
   Are we going to have a picnic?
   Are they going to move to a new city?
