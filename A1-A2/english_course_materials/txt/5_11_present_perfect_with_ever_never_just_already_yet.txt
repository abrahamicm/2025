Hello everyone! In this lesson, we're going to explore how to use the Present Perfect tense with some very useful adverbs: ever, never, just, already, and yet. These words help us talk about experiences and things that have happened recently. Learning how to use them correctly will make your English sound much more natural and help you understand native speakers better. Get ready to dive in!

What is the Present Perfect Tense? (A Quick Reminder)

Before we start, let's quickly remember the Present Perfect tense. It's formed like this:

have/has + past participle

   I/You/We/They have seen
   He/She/It has eaten

We use the Present Perfect to talk about:

   Experiences in our lives (without saying exactly when they happened).
   Actions that started in the past and continue to the present.
   Recent actions that have a connection to the present.

Now, let's add ever, never, just, already, and yet to the mix!

Ever and Never: Talking About Experiences

   Ever:  Ever means "at any time in your life."  We mostly use it in questions.

       Have you ever been to Italy? (This means: "At any point in your life, have you visited Italy?")
       Has she ever tried sushi?
       Have they ever played tennis?

   Never: Never means "not at any time."  We use it in affirmative (positive) sentences to make a negative statement. (Remember, we don't usually use double negatives in English!)

       I have never been to Japan. (This means: "At no point in my life have I visited Japan.")
       He has never seen snow.
       We have never eaten snails!

Important Note:  Ever and never relate to the lifetime of the subject!

Just and Already: Talking About Recent Events

   Just: Just means "a very short time ago."  We put it between 'have/has' and the past participle.

       I have just finished my homework. (This means: "I finished my homework a few minutes ago.")
       She has just arrived.
       They have just eaten lunch.

   Already: Already means "before now" or "sooner than expected."  We usually put it between 'have/has' and the past participle. It can also go at the end of the sentence for emphasis.

       I have already seen that movie. (This means: "I watched that movie before now.")
       He has already finished his work.
       We have eaten dinner already.

Yet: Talking About Things We Expect to Happen

   Yet: Yet means "until now."  We use it in negative sentences and questions to talk about something we expect to happen. It usually goes at the end of the sentence.

       I haven't finished my homework yet. (This means: "I expect to finish my homework soon, but I haven't done it yet.")
       She hasn't arrived yet.
       Have you eaten lunch yet? (This means: "I expect you to eat lunch soon, have you eaten it?")
       Has he called you yet?

Key Points about 'Yet':

   Negative Sentences: something is expected to happen.
   Questions:  we want to know if something has happened.
