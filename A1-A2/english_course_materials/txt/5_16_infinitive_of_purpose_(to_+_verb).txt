The infinitive of purpose is a phrase that uses the word "to" followed by a base form of a verb (e.g., to eat, to go, to learn). It explains the reason or purpose for doing something. It answers the question: "Why did someone do something?"

   Subject: The person or thing doing the action.
   Verb: The main action being done.
   ... : Other information or objects in the sentence.
   to + Base Form of Verb: This is the infinitive of purpose - it tells us why the action is done.
