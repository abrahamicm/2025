Telling the Time

The Basics

   O'Clock: We use "o'clock" for times that are on the hour.
       Example: It's 1 o'clock. (1:00)
       Example: It's 5 o'clock. (5:00)

   Past: We use "past" to say the minutes after the hour.
       Example: It's five past one. (1:05)
       Example: It's ten past three. (3:10)
       Example: It's twenty past two. (2:20)
       Example: It's twenty-five past four. (4:25)

   Half Past: "Half past" means 30 minutes after the hour.
       Example: It's half past six. (6:30)
       Example: It's half past eleven. (11:30)

   To: We use "to" to say the minutes before the next hour.
       Example: It's ten to two. (1:50)
       Example: It's twenty to five. (4:40)
       Example: It's five to ten. (9:55)

   Quarter Past / Quarter To: "Quarter" means 15 minutes.
       Example: It's quarter past three. (3:15)
       Example: It's quarter to eight. (7:45)

Let's look at some more examples:

   1:15: It's quarter past one.
   2:30: It's half past two.
   3:45: It's quarter to four.
   4:00: It's four o'clock.
   5:10: It's ten past five.
   6:55: It's five to seven.

A.M. and P.M.

   A.M. (Ante Meridiem):  From midnight (12:00 AM) to noon (12:00 PM).  Think of it as "before midday".
       Example: 7:00 AM is seven o'clock in the morning.
   P.M. (Post Meridiem): From noon (12:00 PM) to midnight (12:00 AM). Think of it as "after midday".
       Example: 7:00 PM is seven o'clock in the evening.

How to Write Dates

In English, there are two common ways to write dates:

   British English: Day / Month / Year (e.g., 25/12/2024)  Read as "the twenty-fifth of December, twenty twenty-four."
   American English: Month / Day / Year (e.g., 12/25/2024) Read as "December twenty-fifth, twenty twenty-four."

Important: Be careful! The order is different.
