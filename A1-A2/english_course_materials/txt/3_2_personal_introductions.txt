Detailed Explanation with Examples

Introducing yourself is more than just saying your name.  It's about giving people some basic information about you.  Here's how to do it:

Greetings:

   Hello: This is a very common and simple greeting.
       Example: "Hello, my name is..."
   Hi:  Similar to "Hello," but a bit more informal.
       Example: "Hi, I'm..."
   Good morning/afternoon/evening: Use these at the appropriate time of day.
       Example: "Good morning, my name is..."

Saying your name:

   My name is... (formal)
       Example: "Hello, my name is Maria."
   I am... (formal)
       Example: "Good afternoon, I am David."
   I'm... (short for "I am," more common)
       Example: "Hi, I'm Sarah."
   You can call me... (more casual, suggests what you prefer to be called)
       Example: "Hello, my name is Elizabeth, but you can call me Liz."
