5.8. Modal verbs (can/can't, could, should/shouldn't, must/mustn't, have to/don't have to)

Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of modal verbs! These little words are like magic keys that unlock different ways to express ourselves in English. They help us talk about ability, possibility, obligation, and advice. Learning these verbs will significantly improve your communication skills and make your English sound more natural. Let's dive in!

What are Modal Verbs?

Modal verbs are auxiliary (helping) verbs that add meaning to the main verb in a sentence. They don't change their form (no -s for the third person singular!). They are always followed by the base form of the main verb (the infinitive without "to").

For example:

   He can speak English. ("can" is the modal verb, "speak" is the base form of the main verb)
   We should study more. ("should" is the modal verb, "study" is the base form of the main verb)

Let's look at the most common modal verbs for A1-A2 level:

Can / Can't (Ability & Permission)

   Can: Expresses ability or permission in the present.
   Can't: Expresses inability or prohibition.

Examples:

   Ability: I can swim. (I know how to swim)  She can play the guitar.
   Permission: You can use my phone. (I allow you to use my phone) Can I go to the toilet, please? (Asking for permission)
   Inability:  I can't speak Spanish. (I don't know how to speak Spanish) He can't come to the party.
   Prohibition: You can't smoke here. (It's not allowed)  You can't enter without a ticket.

Structure:

   Affirmative: Subject + can + base form of verb
   Negative: Subject + can't + base form of verb
   Question: Can + subject + base form of verb

Could (Past Ability & Polite Requests)

   Could:  Expresses ability in the past, or a polite request.

Examples:

   Past Ability: I could ride a bike when I was five. (I knew how to ride a bike then) She could speak French fluently when she lived in Paris.
   Polite Request:  Could you please open the window? Could I have some water, please?

Structure:

   Affirmative: Subject + could + base form of verb
   Question (Polite Request): Could + subject + base form of verb

Note: While "could" can express past ability, "was/were able to" is also common. "I was able to finish the race" is a stronger statement than "I could finish the race" implying more effort or difficulty was involved.

Should / Shouldn't (Advice)

   Should:  Gives advice or recommendations.
   Shouldn't:  Gives negative advice or recommendations.

Examples:

   Advice: You should eat more vegetables. You should study for the test.
   Negative Advice: You shouldn't eat too much junk food. You shouldn't stay up late before school.

Structure:

   Affirmative: Subject + should + base form of verb
   Negative: Subject + shouldn't + base form of verb

Must / Mustn't (Obligation & Prohibition)

   Must: Expresses a strong obligation or necessity.
   Mustn't: Expresses a strong prohibition (something that is strictly forbidden).

Examples:

   Obligation: I must go to work. (It's necessary for me to go to work)  You must wear a seatbelt in the car.
   Prohibition: You mustn't touch the paintings. (It's forbidden) You mustn't drive too fast.

Structure:

   Affirmative: Subject + must + base form of verb
   Negative: Subject + mustn't + base form of verb

Have to / Don't Have to (Obligation & Lack of Obligation)

   Have to: Expresses obligation, often imposed by an external rule or law.
   Don't have to: Expresses a lack of obligation (it's not necessary).

Examples:

   Obligation: I have to wear a uniform to school.  She has to finish her homework tonight. (Note the "has to" for the third person singular - she, he, it)
   Lack of Obligation: You don't have to come to the meeting if you're busy. I don't have to get up early on Sundays.

Structure:

   Affirmative: Subject + have to / has to (for he/she/it) + base form of verb
   Negative: Subject + don't have to / doesn't have to (for he/she/it) + base form of verb

Important Difference: Must vs. Have to

While both "must" and "have to" express obligation, there's a subtle difference.  "Must" often comes from the speaker's own feeling or a rule they impose on themselves. "Have to" usually comes from an external rule or authority.

   I must remember to call my mother. (My own feeling of obligation)
   I have to wear a uniform to school. (School rule)
