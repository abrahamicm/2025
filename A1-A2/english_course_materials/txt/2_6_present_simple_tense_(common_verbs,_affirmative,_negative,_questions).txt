2.6. Present Simple Tense (Common Verbs, Affirmative, Negative, Questions)

Introduction

Hello learners! Welcome to a crucial part of learning English grammar: the Present Simple Tense!  This tense is used to talk about habits, routines, general truths, and facts. It's one of the first tenses you'll learn and use regularly, so understanding it well is super important for everyday conversations. Let's dive in!

What is the Present Simple Tense?

The Present Simple tense describes:

   Habits and Routines: Things we do regularly (every day, every week, etc.)
   General Truths and Facts: Things that are always true.
   Scheduled Events: Things that happen according to a schedule (like trains or buses).

Affirmative Sentences (Positive Statements)

   Subject + Verb (base form)
       I / You / We / They + Verb (base form)  
           Example: I eat breakfast every morning.
           Example: They play football on Sundays.
           Example: We watch movies at night.
           Example: You study English.

       He / She / It + Verb + -s / -es  (*Third person singular - IMPORTANT!)
           Example: He eats breakfast every morning.
           Example: She plays the piano.
           Example: It rains a lot in April.
           Example: My dog barks at strangers.

    Important Notes:

       For most verbs, we simply add "-s" to the base form for he/she/it.
       For verbs ending in -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, or -o, we add "-es":
           Example:  He watches TV.  She kisses her baby. It goes to sleep. He fixes cars.
       For verbs ending in consonant + y, we change the "y" to "i" and add "-es":
           Example:  He studies English. (study -> studies)  She flies a kite. (fly -> flies)

Negative Sentences

   Subject + do/does + not + Verb (base form)

       I / You / We / They + do not (don't) + Verb (base form)
           Example: I do not (don't) like coffee.
           Example: They do not (don't) live in London.
           Example: We do not (don't) understand the question.
           Example: You do not (don't) speak Italian.

       He / She / It + does not (doesn't) + Verb (base form)  (Notice the verb goes back to the base form!)
           Example: He does not (doesn't) eat meat.
           Example: She does not (doesn't) play basketball.
           Example: It does not (doesn't) snow in summer.
           Example: My cat does not (doesn't) drink milk.

    Important:  We use "do not" (don't) and "does not" (doesn't) to make sentences negative. After "don't" or "doesn't", the verb is ALWAYS in its base form (no -s/-es).

Question Sentences

   Do/Does + Subject + Verb (base form) + ?

       Do + I / You / We / They + Verb (base form) + ?
           Example: Do you like pizza?
           Example: Do they work on weekends?
           Example: Do we need milk?
           Example: Do I understand you?

       Does + He / She / It + Verb (base form) + ?  (Again, the verb is in the base form!)
