9.7. Writing Brief Biographies

Introduction: Who are you? Who are they?

Hello everyone! Today, we're going to learn how to write short stories about people's lives. These short stories are called "biographies."  A biography tells us about someone’s life - what they did, where they lived, and why they are important. Knowing how to write a brief biography helps us share information about ourselves and others in a simple and clear way. It's also useful for introducing people or writing simple reports!

What is a Biography?

A biography (pronounced: bye-OG-ruh-fee) is a story about someone's life. A brief biography is a very short version of that story. Think of it as a mini-adventure through someone's life!

   Share information: You can share interesting facts about famous people.
   School projects: You might have to write a short report about a historical figure.
   Online profiles:  Writing a "bio" for your social media account.

How to Write a Brief Biography: Step-by-Step

Here's a simple guide to writing a brief biography:

Step 1: Choose Your Person

Who are you writing about?  It can be yourself, a family member, a friend, or someone famous. For example, let's choose a famous person: Marie Curie.

Step 2: Gather Basic Information

Find out the important details about the person.  Focus on these things:

   Full Name: Marie Skłodowska Curie
   Date of Birth: November 7, 1867
   Place of Birth: Warsaw, Poland
   What they did (Occupation): Scientist (Physicist and Chemist)
   Why they are famous (Achievement):  Discovered radium and polonium. First woman to win a Nobel Prize. Only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.
   Date of Death: July 4, 1934
   Place of Death: Sallanches, France

Step 3: Write Simple Sentences

Now, use the information to write simple sentences.  Use present simple tense (for what they are or do now) or past simple tense (for what they did in the past).

   Example:
       Marie Curie was born in Poland.
       She was a famous scientist.
       She discovered radium and polonium.
       She won a Nobel Prize.

Step 4: Put the Sentences Together in a Paragraph

Combine the sentences into a short paragraph. Use linking words like "and," "because," "but," and "so" to connect the ideas.

Example:

Marie Curie was born in Poland on November 7, 1867. She was a famous scientist.  She discovered radium and polonium.  She won a Nobel Prize because of her important discoveries.  She died on July 4, 1934, in France.

Step 5: Add a Finishing Sentence (Optional)

You can add a sentence at the end to summarise their importance or legacy.

Example:

Marie Curie was born in Poland on November 7, 1867. She was a famous scientist.  She discovered radium and polonium.  She won a Nobel Prize because of her important discoveries. She died on July 4, 1934, in France.  She is remembered as one of the most important scientists of all time.
