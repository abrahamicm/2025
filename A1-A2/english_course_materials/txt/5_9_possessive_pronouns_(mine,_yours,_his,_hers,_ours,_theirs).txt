5.9. Possessive pronouns (mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs)

Introduction: What are Possessive Pronouns and Why are They Important?

Hello everyone! Today, we're going to learn about possessive pronouns. These words are super useful because they help us talk about things that belong to someone without repeating the noun.  Think of it like this: instead of saying "This is Sarah's book," you can say "This book is hers."  Knowing possessive pronouns will make your English sound more natural and help you understand others better. Let's get started!

What are Possessive Pronouns?

Possessive pronouns show ownership. They replace possessive adjectives (my, your, his, her, our, their) + noun.  Think of them as a shortcut! Here's a list:

| Possessive Pronoun | Who it Belongs To       | Example                                     |
|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| mine            | to me                    | This pencil is mine. (This pencil belongs to me) |
| yours           | to you                   | Is this bag yours? (Does this bag belong to you?) |
| his             | to him                   | That car is his. (That car belongs to him.) |
| hers            | to her                   | This jacket is hers. (This jacket belongs to her.) |
| ours            | to us                    | This house is ours. (This house belongs to us.) |
| theirs          | to them                  | Those toys are theirs. (Those toys belong to them.) |

Important Notes:

   Possessive pronouns stand alone. They don't need to be followed by a noun.
   There is NO apostrophe in possessive pronouns (e.g., theirs not their's). This is a common mistake!
   "Its" is a possessive adjective (like my, your, his, etc.) and not a possessive pronoun. There isn't a possessive pronoun form for it.
