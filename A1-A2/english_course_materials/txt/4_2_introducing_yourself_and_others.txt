4.2. Introducing yourself and others: A Beginner's Guide

Introduction

Hello everyone! Learning how to introduce yourself and others is one of the very first and most important things you can do when learning English. It's how you start conversations, make friends, and build relationships. This lesson will help you learn simple phrases and practice using them. Let's get started!

Why is it important?

   First Impressions: Introductions are often the first impression you make on someone.
   Building Connections: Knowing how to introduce yourself and others allows you to connect with new people.
   Social Situations: It's essential for navigating everyday social situations, like meeting colleagues or making small talk.

Introducing Yourself

The simplest way to introduce yourself is to say your name. Here are a few common ways:

   "Hello, I'm [Your Name]." (Very common and polite)
       Example: "Hello, I'm Maria."
   "Hi, I'm [Your Name]." (More casual)
       Example: "Hi, I'm John."
   "My name is [Your Name]." (More formal)
       Example: "My name is David."
   "I am [Your Name]." (Also quite formal)
       Example: "I am Anna."

After introducing yourself, you can add:

   "Nice to meet you." (Polite and friendly)
       Example: "Hello, I'm Maria. Nice to meet you."
   "Pleased to meet you." (Slightly more formal than "Nice to meet you.")
       Example: "My name is David. Pleased to meet you."

How to respond when someone introduces themselves to you:

   "Nice to meet you, too."
       Example: Someone says: "Hello, I'm Sarah." You reply: "Nice to meet you, too."
   "Pleased to meet you, too." (More formal)
       Example: Someone says: "My name is Mr. Smith." You reply: "Pleased to meet you, too."

Introducing Others

When you introduce two people, you tell each person the other person's name. Here's how:

   "This is [Person's Name]." (Very common)
       Example: "Maria, this is John."
   "[Person A], meet [Person B]." (Also very common)
       Example: "Maria, meet John."
   "I'd like you to meet [Person's Name]." (More formal)
       Example: "Maria, I'd like you to meet Mr. Smith."

Adding information:

After introducing them, you can add a little information about each person.

   "John, this is Maria. She's my colleague."
   "Maria, meet John. He's a student from Spain."

Example Conversation:

You: "Hello, I'm Emily. Nice to meet you."
Friend 1: "Hi Emily, I'm Chris. Nice to meet you, too."
You: "Chris, this is David. He's my friend from university."
Chris: "Hi David, nice to meet you."
David: "Hi Chris, nice to meet you too."
