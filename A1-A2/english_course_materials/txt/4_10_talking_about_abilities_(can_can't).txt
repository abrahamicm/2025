4.10. Talking about abilities (can/can't)

Introduction: Why is this important?

Hello everyone! Today, we are going to learn about how to talk about abilities â€“ what you can do and what you can't do. This is super useful because you can tell people about your skills and interests, and also ask them about theirs. Knowing how to use "can" and "can't" will help you communicate much more effectively in English! Get ready to tell the world what amazing things you can do!

What does "can" and "can't" mean?

   Can: Means you are able to do something. You have the skill or the possibility to do it.
   Can't: Means you are not able to do something. You don't have the skill, the possibility, or it's not allowed. It's a short form of "cannot."

How to Use "Can" and "Can't"

The structure is simple:

Subject + can/can't + verb (base form)

Let's break it down:

   Subject: Who or what is doing the action? (I, you, he, she, it, we, they)
   can/can't: Shows ability or lack of ability.
   Verb (base form): The action word. We never add "-s," "-ed," or "-ing" after "can" or "can't."

Examples:

   I can swim. (I am able to swim.)
   You can speak English. (You are able to speak English.)
   He can play the guitar. (He is able to play the guitar.)
   She can dance. (She is able to dance.)
   It can fly. (Referring to a bird, for example.)
   We can cook. (We are able to cook.)
   They can sing. (They are able to sing.)

Examples with "Can't":

   I can't fly. (I am not able to fly.)
   You can't drive. (If you don't have a license or are too young.)
   He can't cook. (He doesn't know how to cook.)
   She can't speak French. (She hasn't learned French.)
   It can't read. (Referring to a pet, for example.)
   We can't understand. (We don't understand something.)
   They can't see. (They are blind, or it's too dark.)

Asking Questions with "Can"

To ask if someone can do something, we change the order:

Can + Subject + Verb (base form)?

Examples:

   Can you swim?
   Can he play the piano?
   Can she ride a bike?
   Can they speak Spanish?
   Can we go home now?

Short Answers:

   Yes, I can. / No, I can't.
   Yes, he can. / No, he can't.
   Yes, she can. / No, she can't.
   Yes, they can. / No, they can't.
   Yes, we can. / No, we can't.

   Activities: playing sports (football, basketball, tennis), riding a bike, using a computer, fixing things, solving puzzles, baking
   Adverbs of Ability (Optional):  Well, badly (For example:  "I can play the piano well." / "I can sing badly.")
