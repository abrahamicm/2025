7.2. Talking about future plans

Introduction:

Hi everyone! Welcome to our lesson on talking about future plans! Learning how to talk about the future is super important because it helps you share your dreams, make appointments, and simply tell people what you want to do! Even at the A1-A2 level, you can learn to express your plans in simple and clear ways. Let's get started!

Why is this important?

Knowing how to talk about the future helps you:

   Socialize: Make plans with friends ("Let's go to the cinema on Saturday!").
   Travel: Tell people about your travel plans ("I am going to visit Paris next year.").
   Study/Work: Discuss your future goals ("I want to learn English").
   Organize your life: Make appointments ("I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.").

Simple Future with "going to"

We use "going to" to talk about plans and intentions. It means you have already decided what you are going to do.

Structure:

   Subject + am/is/are + going to + base form of the verb

Examples:

   I am going to watch a movie tonight.
   He is going to play football tomorrow.
   They are going to eat pizza for dinner.
   We are going to visit our grandparents next week.
   She is going to study English after school.
   It is going to rain this afternoon (We can also use this to make predictions based on evidence).
   You are going to have a great time on vacation!

Negative Form:

   Subject + am/is/are + not + going to + base form of the verb

Examples:

   I am not going to cook dinner.
   He is not going to go to the party.
   They are not going to buy a new car.
   We are not going to watch TV tonight.
   She is not going to clean her room.
   It is not going to snow tomorrow.
   You are not going to be late for school!

Questions:

   Am/Is/Are + subject + going to + base form of the verb?

Examples:

   Are you going to travel this summer?
   Is he going to work on Sunday?
   Are they going to have a party?
   Am I going to pass the exam?
   Is she going to call me later?

Short answers:

   Yes, I am. / No, I am not.
   Yes, he/she/it is. / No, he/she/it isn't.
   Yes, you/we/they are. / No, you/we/they aren't.

Simple Future with "will"

We also use "will" to talk about future plans, but often for things we decide at the moment of speaking, or for predictions.  Sometimes it's a promise or an offer.

Structure:

   Subject + will + base form of the verb

Examples:

   I will help you with your homework. (Offer)
   He will be there at 7 pm. (Promise)
   They will probably arrive late. (Prediction)
   We will go shopping tomorrow. (Decided now)
   She will call you back later. (Promise)
   It will rain tonight. (Prediction)
   You will enjoy the concert. (Prediction)

Contraction:

We often shorten "will" to "'ll": I'll, he'll, she'll, it'll, we'll, you'll, they'll.

Negative Form:

   Subject + will not + base form of the verb
    Or, more commonly:
   Subject + won't + base form of the verb

Examples:

   I won't forget your birthday.
   He will not be happy about this. (More formal)
   They won't come to the party.
   We won't watch TV tonight.
   She won't tell anyone.
   It won't be easy.
   You won't believe what happened!

Questions:

   Will + subject + base form of the verb?

Examples:

   Will you help me?
   Will he be there?
   Will they come?
   Will we pass the test?
   Will she call me?

Short answers:

   Yes, I will. / No, I won't.
   Yes, he/she/it will. / No, he/she/it won't.
   Yes, you/we/they will. / No, you/we/they won't.

Present Continuous for Future Arrangements

We use the Present Continuous (Subject + am/is/are + verb-ing) to talk about arrangements we've already made, often with a time or place.

Examples:

   I am meeting my friend tomorrow. (Arrangement is already made, likely confirmed).
   He is playing basketball this afternoon.
   They are visiting their family next weekend.
   We are having a picnic on Sunday.
   She is flying to Italy next month.

Important Note: Usually, there's some evidence or preparation done when we use the present continuous for future arrangements (e.g., booking a ticket, confirming with a friend).

Common Phrases and Vocabulary:

   Tomorrow: The day after today.
   Next week/month/year: The week/month/year after this one.
   In the future: Sometime later.
   Tonight: This evening.
