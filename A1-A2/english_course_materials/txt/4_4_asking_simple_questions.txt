4.4. Asking Simple Questions

Introduction: Why is this Important?

Asking questions is a fundamental part of communication! It's how we learn, connect with others, and get the information we need. At the A1-A2 level, you're learning the basics of English. Being able to ask simple questions will help you survive in everyday situations, make friends, and understand the world around you. This lesson will guide you through the most common question structures and phrases for beginners. Let's get started!

Asking Questions: The Basics

In English, we often change the word order to ask questions. Let's look at some common ways to form simple questions:

Using "Be" verbs (am, is, are):

   Statement: You are happy.
   Question: Are you happy?

   Statement: She is a student.
   Question: Is she a student?

   Statement: I am late.
   Question: Am I late?

Important: Notice how we switch the "be" verb and the subject (you, she, I).

Examples:

   "Is he your brother?" (Yes, he is. / No, he isn't.)
   "Are they from Spain?" (Yes, they are. / No, they aren't.)
   "Am I correct?" (Yes, you are. / No, you aren't.)

Using "Do" / "Does" for other verbs (like, work, live, eat):

We use "do" and "does" to ask questions about actions or routines.

   Use "Do" with: I, you, we, they
   Use "Does" with: He, she, it

   Statement: You like pizza.
   Question: Do you like pizza?

   Statement: She works here.
   Question: Does she work here?  (Notice the verb "works" becomes "work".)

Important: When using "does," the main verb loses the "-s" ending.

Examples:

   "Do you speak English?" (Yes, I do. / No, I don't.)
   "Does he live in London?" (Yes, he does. / No, he doesn't.)
   "Do they play football?" (Yes, they do. / No, they don't.)

Using Question Words (Wh- questions):

These words help us ask specific questions:

   What: (for things) What is your name? What are you doing?
   Where: (for places) Where do you live? Where is the bathroom?
   When: (for time) When is your birthday? When do you go to school?
   Who: (for people) Who is that? Who are you talking to?
   Why: (for reasons) Why are you sad? Why are you late?
   How: (for manner/way) How are you? How do you spell that?
   How much: (for uncountable nouns like water, money) How much water do you drink?
   How many: (for countable nouns like apples, people) How many apples do you have?

Structure (Wh- word + auxiliary verb + subject + main verb):

   "Where do you live?"
   "What is your name?"
   "When does the class start?"

Asking for Clarification (Repeating and Checking):

Sometimes we don't understand something. Here are some helpful phrases:

   "Sorry?" (If you didn't hear something)
   "Excuse me?" (To politely ask someone to repeat themselves)
   "Can you repeat that, please?" (More formal)
   "What do you mean?" (To ask for an explanation)
   "Do you mean...?" (To check if you understand correctly)

Common Phrases and Vocabulary

   Question words: what, where, when, who, why, how
   Be verbs: am, is, are, was, were
   Auxiliary verbs: do, does, did
   Common verbs: like, live, work, eat, drink, have, speak, play, go
   Polite phrases: please, thank you, excuse me, sorry
   Example Questions:
       "What is this?"

       "Do you have a pen?"
       "Are you from Italy?"
       "How are you today?"
