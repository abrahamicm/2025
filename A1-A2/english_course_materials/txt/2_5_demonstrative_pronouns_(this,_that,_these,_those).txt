2.5. Demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those)

Introduction: Why learn about "this," "that," "these," and "those"?

Hello everyone! Today we're going to learn about demonstrative pronouns. These little words – this, that, these, and those – are super important for pointing things out and making sure people know exactly what you're talking about. Imagine trying to order food if you couldn't say "I want this sandwich!" See? Important! They help us communicate clearly and directly. Let's get started!

What are Demonstrative Pronouns?

Demonstrative pronouns help us point to specific people, places, or things. They show whether something is near or far from us, and whether it's singular (one) or plural (more than one). Think of them as your pointing fingers in language!

Here's a simple table to explain them:

| Pronoun | Number    | Distance | Example                                     |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| This  | Singular  | Near     | This is my book. (I'm holding it)     |
| That  | Singular  | Far      | That is my house. (I'm pointing to it) |
| These | Plural    | Near     | These are my shoes. (I'm wearing them)  |
| Those | Plural    | Far      | Those are my friends. (I see them across the street)  |

Detailed Explanation with Examples

Let's look at each pronoun more closely:

   This (Singular, Near): Use this when talking about ONE thing that is close to you.

       This apple is delicious! (You're eating the apple)
       "What is this?" (You're holding something and asking what it is)
       This is my best friend, Sarah. (You are next to Sarah)

   That (Singular, Far): Use that when talking about ONE thing that is further away from you.

       That car is very fast. (You're pointing to a car)
       "What is that over there?" (You're pointing to something distant)
       That sounds like a good idea! (Referring to something someone said)

   These (Plural, Near): Use these when talking about MORE THAN ONE thing that are close to you.

       These cookies are for you. (You are holding the cookies)
       "Are these your keys?" (You are holding some keys and asking someone)
       These flowers smell wonderful. (You are smelling flowers nearby)

   Those (Plural, Far): Use those when talking about MORE THAN ONE thing that are further away from you.

       Those birds are flying south. (You're watching birds in the distance)
       "Who are those people?" (You're pointing to a group of people)
       Those were the days! (Talking about past events)

Important Notes:

   "Near" and "Far" are relative. They depend on the situation.
   We sometimes use "this" and "that" on the phone to introduce ourselves: "Hello, this is [your name]." Or when receiving a call, "Speaking. This is [your name]."
   "That" can also mean "the one I'm talking about": "The red shirt or the blue shirt? I want that one (the blue shirt)."
