9.6. Writing Simple Past Narratives: Telling Stories!

Introduction:

Hello everyone! Today, we are going to learn how to write simple past narratives. What does that mean? Well, it means we're going to learn how to tell stories about things that happened in the past. This is super important because it allows you to share your experiences, talk about movies you saw, or even create your own exciting adventures! Learning to use the simple past correctly will make your English sound much clearer and more natural. Let's begin!

What is a Simple Past Narrative?

A simple past narrative is a story that describes events that happened and finished in the past. It's like telling someone what you did yesterday, last week, or years ago.

How to Form the Simple Past Tense:

The simple past tense is usually formed in two ways:

   Regular Verbs: Add '-ed' to the base form of the verb.

       Example: walk → walked, play → played, watch → watched
       Important Note: If the verb ends in 'e', just add 'd'.
           Example: love → loved, bake → baked, smile → smiled
       Another Note: If the verb ends in a consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) pattern and the last syllable is stressed, double the last consonant before adding '-ed'.
           Example: stop → stopped, plan → planned

   Irregular Verbs: These verbs have special forms that you need to memorize. There is no 'ed' rule for these!
       Example: go → went, see → saw, eat → ate, be → was/were, have → had

Using Time Expressions:

Time expressions help readers understand when the story happened. Some common time expressions for the simple past are:

   Yesterday
   Last week/month/year
   Two days ago
   In 2010 (or any past year)
   Once upon a time
   When I was a child

Example 2:
