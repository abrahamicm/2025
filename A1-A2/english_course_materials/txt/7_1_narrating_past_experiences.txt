What is Narrating Past Experiences?

Narrating past experiences simply means telling someone about something that happened to you in the past.  Think about telling a friend about your weekend, or describing a fun holiday you had. It's all about sharing stories!

How to Talk About the Past (Simple Past Tense):

At this level (A1-A2), we'll focus on the Simple Past Tense. It's used for actions that started and finished in the past.

Forming the Simple Past:

   Regular Verbs:  Usually, we add "-ed" to the end of the verb.
       Example:  I walked to school yesterday.  (Walk + ed = Walked)
       Example:  She played the piano last night. (Play + ed = Played)
       If the verb already ends in "-e", just add "-d".
           Example:  He lived in London for five years. (Live + d = Lived)

   Irregular Verbs: These verbs have different forms in the past tense. You need to memorize them. Here are some common irregular verbs:

    | Base Form (Present) | Past Form (Simple Past) |
    |---------------------|-------------------------|
    | be (am, is, are)     | was/were                |
    | do                  | did                     |

    | go                  | went                    |
    | have                | had                     |
    | see                 | saw                     |
    | take                | took                    |
    | get                 | got                     |
    | come                | came                    |
    | make                | made                    |

       Example: I ate pizza for dinner last night.
