9.4. Writing Postcards and Brief Letters: A Simple Guide

Introduction

Hello everyone! Today, we're going to learn about writing postcards and brief letters. These are great ways to stay in touch with friends and family, especially when you're on vacation or just want to send a quick message. Don't worry, it's easier than you think! Learning to write short messages is a useful skill for everyday life.

What are Postcards and Brief Letters?

   Postcard: A small card, often with a picture on one side, that you can write a short message on and send through the mail.
   Brief Letter: A short, informal letter to a friend or family member. It's longer than a postcard but still short and to the point.

Writing a Postcard

Let's break down how to write a postcard. Remember, keep it short and sweet!

The Greeting (Hello!)

   Start with a friendly greeting. Common choices include:
       Hi [Name],
       Hello [Name],
       Dear [Name],

    Example: Hi Sarah,

The Body (Your Message)

   Write about why you are sending the postcard. You can talk about:
       Where you are
       What you're doing
       How you're feeling
       Something you saw
   Keep it simple and use short sentences.

    Example:
    "I'm in Rome! It's beautiful here. I visited the Colosseum today. The food is delicious too!"

The Closing (Goodbye!)

   End with a friendly closing. Common choices include:
       Love,
       Best wishes,
       See you soon,
       Take care,

    Example: Love,

Your Name

   Write your name after the closing.

    Example: Love, John

The Address

   On the other side of the postcard (the side without your message), write the recipient's address clearly.
   Important: Make sure to write the address correctly, including the postcode/zip code!

    Example:

        [Name]
    [Street Address]
    [City, State/Region]
    [Postcode/Zip Code]
    [Country]
    ``

Example Postcard:

Hi Grandma and Grandpa,

I'm in Paris! The Eiffel Tower is amazing. I'm having lots of fun trying new food. The weather is sunny.

Love,
Emily

Writing a Brief Letter

Brief letters are a little longer than postcards, so you can share a bit more information.

The Greeting (Hello!)

   Same as postcards!

    Example: Dear Mom,

The Body (Your Message)

   You can write about:
       How you are doing
       What you have been doing
       Ask questions about the recipient
       Share some news

    Example:
    "How are you? I'm doing well. I started a new job last week. It's interesting! Are you still working in the garden?"

The Closing (Goodbye!)

   Same as postcards!

    Example: Best wishes,

Your Name

   Write your name after the closing.

    Example: Best wishes, David

The Address (If Sending in an Envelope)

   Write the recipient's address on the envelope, just like you would for a postcard. Also include your return address (your address).

Example Brief Letter:

Dear Dad,

How are you? I hope you are well. I went to the beach last weekend. The weather was perfect! I learned to surf.  It was a lot of fun.

Are you still fixing up the car?

See you soon,
Michael
