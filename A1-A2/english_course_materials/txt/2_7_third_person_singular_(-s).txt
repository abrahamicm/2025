2.7. Third Person Singular (-s): He, She, It & the Present Simple

Introduction: Why is the -s Important?

Hello learners! Welcome to a crucial part of English grammar: the third person singular. This might sound complicated, but it just means how verbs change when we talk about he, she, or it in the present. Getting this right is important because it helps people understand you clearly. It shows you understand basic English grammar and makes your sentences sound more natural. Let's learn how to add that little "-s" correctly!

What is the Third Person Singular?

In the present simple tense, we usually add an "-s" to the end of the verb when the subject is a singular noun or pronoun in the third person. This means when we're talking about:

   He: A male person (e.g., John, my brother)
   She: A female person (e.g., Mary, my sister)
   It: An object, animal, or place (e.g., the cat, the house, the car)

Think of it like this: He, She, It, Add an S!

Examples:

   I eat breakfast. (First person singular)
   You eat breakfast. (Second person singular)
   He eats breakfast. (Third person singular - notice the "-s"!)
   She eats breakfast. (Third person singular - notice the "-s"!)
   It eats food. (Third person singular - notice the "-s"!)
   We eat breakfast. (First person plural)
   You eat breakfast. (Second person plural)
   They eat breakfast. (Third person plural)

More Examples:

   I walk to school.  She walks to school.
   You play football. He plays football.
   We watch TV.  It watches (only if it's a smart TV and we're being funny!)

Spelling Rules and Exceptions:

Adding "-s" is usually easy, but sometimes we need to be careful with spelling!

Most Verbs: Just add "-s".
       Work -> Works
       Play -> Plays
       Eat -> Eats
       Read -> Reads

Verbs Ending in -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, -o: Add "-es".
       Kiss -> Kisses
       Wash -> Washes
       Watch -> Watches
       Fix -> Fixes
       Go -> Goes
       Do -> Does

Verbs Ending in "Consonant + y": Change the "y" to "i" and add "-es".
       Study -> Studies
       Cry -> Cries
       Try -> Tries
       Fly -> Flies

Important Exception: The verb "have" becomes "has" for he, she, it.

   I have a car. He has a car.
   You have a bike. She has a bike.
   We have a dog. It has a collar.
