9.5. Writing descriptions of people and places

Introduction:

Hello everyone! In this lesson, we're going to learn how to describe people and places. Being able to describe things is very important in English. It helps you share information, tell stories, and connect with others. Imagine you met a famous actor. You'd want to tell your friends all about them! Or perhaps you visited a beautiful beach. You'd want to share what it was like. This lesson will give you the tools to do just that!

What we will learn:

   How to describe people: appearance (age, height, hair, eyes, clothes) and personality (happy, kind, funny).
   How to describe places: general impression (big, small, beautiful, ugly), location, and key features (e.g., for a park: trees, benches, a playground).
   Useful vocabulary and phrases.
   How to put sentences together to create a description.

Describing People: Appearance

When we describe someone's appearance, we talk about what they look like. Here are some things we can mention:

   Age: young, old, middle-aged, a teenager, a child
       Example: She is a young woman. He is an old man.
   Height: tall, short, medium height
       Example: He is tall. She is short.
   Hair: colour (blonde, brown, black, grey, red), length (long, short, medium length), style (straight, curly, wavy)
       Example: She has long, brown hair. He has short, black hair. Her hair is curly.
   Eyes: colour (blue, brown, green, grey)
       Example: He has blue eyes. She has brown eyes.
   Clothes:  (jeans, t-shirt, dress, jacket, etc.) and their colour
       Example: He is wearing jeans and a t-shirt. She is wearing a red dress.

Examples:

   "He is a tall, young man with short, black hair and brown eyes. He's wearing jeans and a blue jacket."
   "She is a short, old woman with long, grey hair. She has green eyes and is wearing a purple dress."

Describing People: Personality

We can also describe what someone is like as a person - their personality. Here are some common adjectives:

   Happy: smiling, cheerful
   Sad: unhappy, upset
   Kind: helpful, friendly
   Funny: makes you laugh, humorous
   Shy: quiet, reserved
   Outgoing: friendly, sociable
   Serious: not joking, thoughtful

Examples:

   "He is happy and funny. He always makes me laugh!"
   "She is kind and helpful. She always helps her friends."
   "He is shy and quiet. He doesn't talk much."

Putting it all together (Appearance and Personality):

"My friend, Maria, is young and tall. She has long, blonde hair and blue eyes. She is very kind and funny. She always makes me smile!"

Describing Places

When we describe a place, we can talk about its size, how it looks, and what we can find there.

   General Impression: big, small, beautiful, ugly, clean, dirty, modern, old
       Example: It is a beautiful park.  The city is big and modern.
   Location: near the sea, in the mountains, in the city, in the countryside
       Example:  The park is in the city.  The village is in the countryside.
   Key Features:
       Park: trees, benches, flowers, playground, grass
           Example:  There are many trees in the park. There is also a playground for children.
       Beach: sand, sea, waves, shells, boats
           Example:  The beach has white sand and blue sea. There are shells on the sand.
       City: buildings, shops, restaurants, streets, cars, buses
           Example: The city has tall buildings and many shops.
       House: rooms (kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom), garden, furniture
           Example:  My house has three bedrooms and a big kitchen. There is a small garden.

Examples:

   "The park is beautiful and big. It's in the city center. There are many trees and flowers.  There is also a playground for children."
   "The beach is small and clean. It's near the sea. The sand is white and the sea is blue."
   "My house is small but cozy. It's in the countryside. There is a living room, a kitchen, and two bedrooms. We have a garden with flowers."
