2.11. Prepositions of place (in, on, under, next to, between)

Introduction:

Hello everyone! Today, we're going to learn about prepositions of place.  Prepositions are words that tell us where something is. Knowing these words will help you describe locations clearly and understand where things are in relation to each other.  Think of it like giving someone directions, or describing what's in a room! This lesson will focus on five common prepositions: in, on, under, next to, and between. Let's get started!

Detailed Explanation with Examples:

Here are the five prepositions we'll be looking at, with explanations and examples:

   1. IN:  In tells us that something is inside something else, or contained within something.

       Example 1: The book is in the bag. (The book is inside the bag.)
       Example 2: The cat is in the box. (The cat is inside the box.)
       Example 3: We live in London. (London is a city, and we live inside it.)
       Example 4: There is water in the glass. (The water is contained within the glass.)

   2. ON: On tells us that something is touching the top surface of something else.

       Example 1: The apple is on the table. (The apple is touching the table's surface.)
       Example 2: The picture is on the wall. (The picture is attached to the wall's surface.)
       Example 3: The cat is on the sofa. (The cat is sitting on the sofa's surface.)
       Example 4: The newspaper is on the floor. (The newspaper is laying flat on the floor.)

   3. UNDER: Under tells us that something is below something else, often covered or hidden.

       Example 1: The cat is under the table. (The cat is below the table, perhaps hiding.)
       Example 2: The ball is under the bed. (The ball rolled below the bed.)
       Example 3: There is a rug under the table. (The rug is placed below the table.)
       Example 4:  The roots of the tree are under the ground.

   4. NEXT TO: Next to tells us that something is beside something else, with one object's side close to another's.  It means close proximity.

       Example 1: The chair is next to the desk. (The chair is beside the desk.)
       Example 2: The supermarket is next to the bank. (The supermarket is beside the bank.)
       Example 3: My house is next to the park. (My house is beside the park.)
       Example 4: Please sit next to me. (Please sit beside me.)

   5. BETWEEN: Between tells us that something is in the middle of two other things.

       Example 1: The table is between the sofa and the chair. (The table is in the middle.)
       Example 2: The shop is between the bakery and the library. (The shop is in the middle.)
       Example 3:  There is a small town between London and Oxford. (The town is on the way from London to Oxford.)
