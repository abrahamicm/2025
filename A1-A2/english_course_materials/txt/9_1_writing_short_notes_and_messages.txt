What are Short Notes and Messages?

Short notes and messages are brief ways to communicate important information. They are usually informal and direct. They can be written on paper, sent via text message (SMS), email, or left on a sticky note.

Key features of a good short note/message:

   Short and Concise: Use only the necessary words.
   Clear and Easy to Understand: Avoid complicated sentences.
   Informal:  Use everyday language, unless it's a very formal situation.
   Specific: Include the important details (who, what, where, when, why).
   Friendly Tone: Use polite phrases like "please" and "thank you" when appropriate.

Types of Short Notes and Messages

Here are some common situations where you might need to write a short note or message:

   Leaving a message for someone:  "I called.  Please call me back."
