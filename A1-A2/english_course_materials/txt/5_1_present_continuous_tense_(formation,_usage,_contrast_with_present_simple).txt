5.1. Present continuous tense (formation, usage, contrast with present simple)

Introduction:

Hello everyone! Today, we're going to learn about the Present Continuous tense. It's a super useful tense that we use to talk about things that are happening right now or around now. Understanding and using the Present Continuous will help you describe what people are doing, talk about temporary situations, and express future plans. So, let's get started!

What is the Present Continuous Tense?

The Present Continuous tense (also called Present Progressive) describes actions that are happening at the moment of speaking or around this time. It’s about things that are in progress.

How to Form the Present Continuous Tense:

The Present Continuous tense is formed using:

   am / is / are + verb + -ing

Let's break it down:

   Subject + Auxiliary Verb (am/is/are) + Main Verb + -ing

Examples:

| Subject    | Auxiliary Verb | Main Verb  | -ing Form  | Sentence                              |
|------------|----------------|------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| I          | am             | play       | playing    | I am playing video games.              |
| He/She/It | is             | eat        | eating     | He is eating an apple.                 |
| You/We/They| are            | watch      | watching   | They are watching a movie.             |

Important notes on adding -ing:

   Most verbs: Just add -ing.  Example:  work -> working,  read -> reading
   Verbs ending in -e:  Remove the -e and add -ing.  Example:  write -> writing,  dance -> dancing
       Exception:  Verbs ending in -ee.  Example:  see -> seeing
   Short verbs with one syllable ending in consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC): Double the last consonant and add -ing. Example:  run -> running,  swim -> swimming
       Exception: Verbs ending in -w, -x, -y. Don't double. Example: show -> showing, fix -> fixing, play -> playing
   Two-syllable verbs where the stress is on the second syllable ending in CVC: Double the last consonant and add -ing. Example: begin -> beginning, prefer -> preferring

When to Use the Present Continuous Tense:

   Actions happening now, at the moment of speaking:

       Example:  "The baby is sleeping." (Right now, the baby is in the process of sleeping.)
       Example:  "I am learning English." (I am in the process of learning English at this time in my life).
   Temporary situations:

       Example: "I am living in London for a few months." (This is not permanent; it will change.)
       Example: "She is working at a coffee shop this summer." (A temporary job.)
   Trends or changing situations:

       Example: "More and more people are using smartphones." (The situation is changing.)
   Future arrangements (with a definite time and place - often used at A2 level): This use is less common at A1.

       Example: "We are meeting tomorrow at 10 AM." (This is a planned event in the future). Focus on the 'now' and 'temporary' uses at A1.

Common Phrases and Vocabulary Related to Present Continuous:

   Right now:  "What are you doing right now?"

Present Simple vs. Present Continuous:

This is VERY important!  They are used for different things:

| Feature          | Present Simple                      | Present Continuous                                 |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Use          | Habits, routines, general truths, facts | Actions happening now, temporary situations        |
| Time frame   | Always, usually, often, sometimes, never| Now, at the moment, today, this week/month/year     |
| Form         | Base form of the verb (or -s/-es for he/she/it) | am/is/are + verb + -ing                           |
| Examples     | I eat breakfast every day.             | I am eating breakfast right now.                  |
|                   | She works at a bank.                | She is working from home today.                       |
|                   | The sun rises in the east.            | The sun is shining brightly.  (Right now it is bright) |

   Present Simple:  What you generally do.
   Present Continuous: What you are doing at this moment.
