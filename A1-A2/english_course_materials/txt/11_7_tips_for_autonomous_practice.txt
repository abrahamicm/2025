11.7. Tips for Autonomous Practice for English Learners (A1-A2)

Introduction: Becoming Your Own English Teacher!

Hello everyone! Learning English is like building a house. Lessons with a teacher are like having a strong foundation. But to make your house a home, you need to furnish it yourself!  This means practicing English on your own - we call this autonomous practice. It’s like being your own English teacher!

Autonomous practice is very important because:

   You learn faster: The more you practice, the better you get.
   You become more confident: When you can practice alone, you feel more comfortable speaking and understanding English.
   It fits your schedule: You can practice whenever you have time.
   It's fun! You can choose activities you enjoy.

This lesson will give you some easy and fun tips to practice English by yourself!

       Write "chair" and stick it on the chair.
   Why it works: You see the English word every day, so you remember it easily.
