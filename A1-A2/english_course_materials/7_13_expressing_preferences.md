## 7.13. Expressing Preferences

### Introduction

Hello everyone! Welcome to our lesson on expressing preferences.  Learning how to express what you like and dislike is a fundamental part of communication.  It allows you to share your personality, make choices, and participate more actively in conversations.  In this lesson, we'll learn simple and useful ways to tell people what you prefer. Get ready to share your opinions!

### Why is it important?

Expressing preferences is important because:

*   **You can make choices:** Deciding what you want to eat, what activity to do, or what movie to watch becomes easier.
*   **You can share your personality:** Let others know what you enjoy and what you don't.
*   **You can participate in conversations:** Engage in discussions and express your opinions.
*   **You can avoid misunderstandings:**  Clearly state your preferences to avoid getting things you dislike.

### Explanation with Examples

We can express preferences using different phrases. Let's look at some common and easy ones:

**1. I like... / I don't like...**

This is the simplest way to express your likes and dislikes.

*   **Example:**  I like cats. I don't like spiders.
*   **Example:** I like pizza. I don't like broccoli.
*   **Example:** I like reading books. I don't like watching horror movies.

**2. I love... / I hate...**

These are stronger expressions. "Love" means you like something very much, and "hate" means you dislike something very much.

*   **Example:** I love chocolate. I hate cleaning the house.
*   **Example:** I love listening to music. I hate getting up early.
*   **Example:** I love playing football. I hate doing homework.

**3. I prefer...**

"Prefer" means you like one thing more than another.

*   **Example:** I prefer tea to coffee. (I like tea more than coffee.)
*   **Example:** I prefer going to the beach to going to the mountains. (I like the beach more than the mountains.)
*   **Example:** I prefer reading a book to watching TV. (I like reading more than watching TV.)

**4. I enjoy...**

"Enjoy" is similar to "like," but often refers to activities.

*   **Example:** I enjoy playing games.
*   **Example:** I enjoy spending time with my friends.
*   **Example:** I enjoy cooking.

**5. I'm interested in...**

This shows you find something fascinating.

*   **Example:** I'm interested in learning about history.
*   **Example:** I'm interested in learning new languages.
*   **Example:** I'm interested in science fiction movies.

**Important Grammar Note:**

*   After "like," "love," "hate," "enjoy," and "prefer," we often use the verb in the -ing form (gerund) if it's an activity: *like playing*, *love reading*, *hate cleaning*.
*   When comparing, use "to" with "prefer" : *I prefer A to B.*
