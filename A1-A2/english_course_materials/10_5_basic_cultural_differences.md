# 10.5 Basic Cultural Differences

## Introduction

Hello! Welcome to our lesson on basic cultural differences. Learning a new language is not just about grammar and vocabulary. It's also about understanding the culture where that language is spoken. Knowing about cultural differences can help you communicate better, avoid misunderstandings, and make new friends! Today, we will learn some common cultural differences to make your experience with English and English-speaking countries more enjoyable.

## What are Cultural Differences?

Cultural differences are the different ways people behave, think, and believe in different parts of the world. These differences can affect many things, like how people greet each other, what they eat, and how they celebrate holidays.

Let's look at some common examples:

**1. Greetings:**

*   **Western Cultures (e.g., USA, UK, Australia):** Often shake hands, say "Hello," or "Hi." A smile is common.
    *   Example: "Hello, my name is John." *shakes hand*
*   **Some Asian Cultures (e.g., Japan, South Korea):** Often bow. A deeper bow shows more respect.
    *   Example: *bows slightly* "Hello."
*   **Some European Cultures (e.g., France, Italy, Spain):** Sometimes kiss on the cheeks (number of kisses varies by region).
    *   Example: *kisses lightly on both cheeks* "Bonjour!" (France)

**2. Eye Contact:**

*   **Western Cultures:** Making eye contact is usually considered polite and shows you are listening.
    *   Example: When someone is talking, you look at them in the eye.
*   **Some Asian and African Cultures:** Prolonged or direct eye contact with someone older or in authority can be seen as disrespectful.
    *   Example: When speaking to your teacher, you might avoid direct eye contact for too long.

**3. Food and Eating:**

*   **Western Cultures:** Often use forks, knives, and spoons. Meals are usually individual portions.
    *   Example: "Can I have a fork, please?"
*   **Some Asian Cultures:** Often use chopsticks or eat with their hands (depending on the food and region). Food is often shared from central dishes.
    *   Example: *uses chopsticks to pick up rice* "This is delicious!"
*   **Tipping:** In many Western countries, it is common to tip waiters and other service staff (e.g., in restaurants, taxis). This is usually a percentage of the bill (e.g., 15-20%).
    *   Example: "The bill is $20. I'll leave a $4 tip."

**4. Personal Space:**

*   **Western Cultures:** People usually prefer to keep some distance between themselves and others.
    *   Example: You might stand about an arm's length away from someone when talking.
*   **Some Latin American and Middle Eastern Cultures:** People may stand closer to each other when talking.
    *   Example: You might stand very close to someone while talking, even touching their arm lightly.

**5. Time:**

*   **Some Western Cultures (e.g., Germany, Switzerland):** Punctuality is very important. Being late is considered impolite.
    *   Example: "The meeting starts at 9:00 AM sharp. Please be on time."
*   **Some Latin American and Mediterranean Cultures:** Being a little late is sometimes acceptable (referred to as "flexible time").
    *   Example: "The party starts at 8:00 PM, but it's okay to arrive around 8:30 PM."

**6. Gift-Giving:**

* **Western Cultures:** Gifts are often opened immediately.
    * Example: You receive a birthday present and open it right away.
* **Some Asian Cultures:** Gifts are often not opened immediately to avoid seeming greedy.
    * Example: You receive a gift and thank the giver but wait to open it later.

## Common Phrases and Vocabulary

*   **Culture:** The way of life of a group of people.
*   **Customs:** Traditional and widely accepted ways of behaving.
*   **Greetings:** Ways of saying hello.
