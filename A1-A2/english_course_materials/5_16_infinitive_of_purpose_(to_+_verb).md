**Introduction: Why learn about "to + verb" for purpose?**

Hello everyone! Understanding how to use "to + verb" to express *purpose* is a very important step in learning English. It helps you explain *why* someone does something. It makes your sentences more informative and interesting. You will be able to answer the question "Why?" more easily! This lesson will teach you how to form and use the "infinitive of purpose" to explain the reason behind an action. Let's get started!

**What is the Infinitive of Purpose?**

The infinitive of purpose is a phrase that uses the word "to" followed by a base form of a verb (e.g., *to eat*, *to go*, *to learn*). It explains the *reason* or *purpose* for doing something. It answers the question: "Why did someone do something?"

**Structure:**

`Subject + Verb + ... + to + Base Form of Verb`

*   **Subject:** The person or thing doing the action.
*   **Verb:** The main action being done.
*   **... :** Other information or objects in the sentence.
*   **to + Base Form of Verb:** This is the infinitive of purpose - it tells us *why* the action is done.

**Examples:**

*   I went to the shop **to buy** bread. (Why did I go to the shop? To buy bread.)
*   She studies English **to travel** around the world. (Why does she study English? To travel around the world.)
*   He exercises every day **to stay** healthy. (Why does he exercise? To stay healthy.)
*   They saved money **to buy** a new car. (Why did they save money? To buy a new car.)
*   We need water **to live**. (Why do we need water? To live.)

**More Detailed Explanation:**

Think of it like this: "to + verb" answers the question "Why?". Look at the previous examples again.

*   "I went to the shop."  **Why?** "To buy bread."
*   "She studies English." **Why?** "To travel around the world."
*   "He exercises every day." **Why?** "To stay healthy."
*   "They saved money." **Why?** "To buy a new car."
*   "We need water." **Why?** "To live."

The phrase "to + verb" comes *after* the main part of the sentence. It's giving you extra information - the *purpose* of the action.
