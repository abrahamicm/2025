## 7.5. Comparing people, places and things

### Introduction: Why is Comparison Important?

Learning to compare people, places, and things is a vital skill in English. It allows you to:

*   Express your opinions and preferences: "I like this apple **more than** that one."
*   Describe differences and similarities: "Sarah is **taller than** Tom, but they are both **good at** sports."
*   Understand and interpret information: "This city is **bigger than** my hometown."

This lesson will teach you the basic grammar and vocabulary needed to make simple comparisons. Let's begin!

### 1. Comparing Adjectives

We often use adjectives (words that describe nouns) when comparing. Here's how to do it:

**A. Short Adjectives (1 or 2 syllables, usually ending in -y)**

*   Add "-er" to the adjective to compare two things.
*   Use "than" after the adjective.

    **Example:**

    *   Adjective: **Tall**
    *   Sentence: Tom is **taller than** Sarah.
    *   Adjective: **Cheap**
    *   Sentence: This shirt is **cheaper than** that shirt.
    *   Adjective: **Happy** (becomes happier)
    *   Sentence: I am **happier than** yesterday.

**Important Spelling Rules:**

*   If the adjective ends in a consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) pattern, double the last consonant before adding "-er".
    *   **Big** -> **Bigger**
    *   **Hot** -> **Hotter**
*   If the adjective ends in "y," change the "y" to "i" before adding "-er."
    *   **Happy** -> **Happier**
    *   **Easy** -> **Easier**

**B. Long Adjectives (2 or more syllables)**

*   Use "more" before the adjective to compare two things.
*   Use "than" after the adjective.

    **Example:**

    *   Adjective: **Expensive**
    *   Sentence: This car is **more expensive than** that car.
    *   Adjective: **Interesting**
    *   Sentence: This book is **more interesting than** that book.
    *   Adjective: **Beautiful**
    *   Sentence: She is **more beautiful than** her sister.

**C. Irregular Adjectives**

Some adjectives are irregular and don't follow these rules. The most common are:

*   **Good** -> **Better**
    *   Example: My English is **better than** it was last year.
*   **Bad** -> **Worse**
    *   Example: The weather today is **worse than** yesterday.
*   **Far** -> **Farther / Further**
    *   Example: My house is **farther** from school than yours. (Farther for distance, Further for more figurative distance)

### 2. Using "As...As" for Similarity

Sometimes we want to show that two things are similar. We use the structure "as + adjective + as."

*   **Example:**

    *   My brother is **as tall as** my father. (They are the same height)
    *   This book is **as interesting as** the movie. (They are equally interesting)
    *   The red car is **as fast as** the blue car. (They are the same speed)

We can also use "not as...as" to show something is *less* than something else.

*   **Example:**

    *   My brother is **not as tall as** my father. (My brother is shorter)
    *   This book is **not as interesting as** the movie. (The book is less interesting)
    *   The red car is **not as fast as** the blue car. (The red car is slower)

### 3. Common Phrases and Vocabulary

Here's some useful vocabulary for making comparisons:

*   **Similar:** Having things in common.  "These two pictures are similar."
*   **Different:** Not the same. "Those two cars are different colors."
*   **The same as:** Exactly alike. "Your shirt is the same as mine!"
*   **Bigger than:** Larger in size. "An elephant is bigger than a cat."
*   **Smaller than:** Less large in size. "A mouse is smaller than a dog."
*   **More expensive than:** Costs more money. "A car is more expensive than a bicycle."
*   **Less expensive than:** Costs less money. "A banana is less expensive than an apple."
*   **Better than:** Of a higher quality. "This coffee is better than that one."
*   **Worse than:** Of a lower quality. "The weather today is worse than yesterday."
*   **Equally:** In the same way or to the same degree. "The players are equally skilled."
