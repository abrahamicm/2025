## 2.1. Verb 'to be' (affirmative, negative and interrogative forms)

### Introduction

Hello everyone! Welcome to this lesson on the verb "to be." It's one of the most fundamental verbs in English and is used constantly. Understanding how to use it correctly is crucial for building simple sentences and expressing yourself clearly. In this lesson, we'll cover the affirmative (positive), negative, and interrogative (question) forms of the verb "to be" in the present tense. Get ready to learn and practice!

### What is the Verb 'To Be'?

The verb "to be" doesn't describe an action like "run" or "eat." Instead, it connects the subject of a sentence to a description, identity, or state of being.  Think of it as saying "is," "am," or "are."

The present tense forms of "to be" are:

*   **am** (used with I)
*   **is** (used with he, she, it, and singular nouns)
*   **are** (used with you, we, they, and plural nouns)

### 1. Affirmative Form (Positive)

This is the basic way to state facts or information.

**Structure:**  Subject + to be (am/is/are) + rest of the sentence

**Examples:**

*   **I am** a student. (Identifying yourself)
*   **He is** tall. (Describing someone)
*   **She is** from Spain. (Giving someone's origin)
*   **It is** a cat. (Identifying an object)
*   **You are** my friend. (Describing a relationship)
*   **We are** happy. (Describing a feeling)
*   **They are** at the park. (Giving a location)
*   The book **is** interesting. (Describing a thing)
*   The students **are** in the classroom. (Giving location of multiple people)

**Contractions (Short Forms):** We often use short forms (contractions) in spoken and informal written English:

*   I am  ->  I'm
*   He is  ->  He's
*   She is ->  She's
*   It is  ->  It's
*   You are ->  You're
*   We are  ->  We're
*   They are ->  They're

**Examples with contractions:**

*   I'm tired.
*   He's a doctor.
*   She's beautiful.
*   It's cold today.
*   You're very kind.
*   We're learning English.
*   They're my parents.

### 2. Negative Form

We use the negative form to say that something is *not* true.

**Structure:** Subject + to be (am/is/are) + *not* + rest of the sentence

**Examples:**

*   **I am not** a teacher.
*   **He is not** short.
*   **She is not** from Italy.
*   **It is not** a dog.
*   **You are not** late.
*   **We are not** sad.
*   **They are not** at home.

**Contractions:** We often use contractions in the negative form as well:

*   is not -> isn't
*   are not -> aren't
*   am not -> (no common contraction except with pronouns like "I ain't," which is considered informal/colloquial and not recommended for beginners.)

**Examples with contractions:**

*   He isn't my brother.
*   She isn't happy.
*   It isn't raining.
*   You aren't right.
*   We aren't ready.
*   They aren't hungry.

**Important Note:** "I am not" usually remains separate.  While "ain't" exists, it's best to avoid it at this level.

### 3. Interrogative Form (Questions)

We use the interrogative form to ask questions.

**Structure:** To be (Am/Is/Are) + Subject + rest of the sentence + ?

**Examples:**

*   **Am I** correct?
*   **Is he** a student?
*   **Is she** your sister?
*   **Is it** raining?
*   **Are you** ready?
*   **Are we** late?
*   **Are they** happy?

**Short Answers:** We often give short answers to these questions using "yes" or "no" followed by the subject and the correct form of "to be":

*   **Question:** Are you a student?  **Answer:** Yes, I am. / No, I am not. (or No, I'm not.)
*   **Question:** Is he tall? **Answer:** Yes, he is. / No, he isn't.
*   **Question:** Are they from Japan? **Answer:** Yes, they are. / No, they aren't.
