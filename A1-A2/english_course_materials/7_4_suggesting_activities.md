**Introduction:**

Hello everyone! Learning English isn't just about grammar rules and vocabulary lists. It's about using the language to connect with others and enjoy new experiences. Today, we're going to learn how to **suggest activities** â€“ how to ask your friends or classmates to do something fun together. This is a very useful skill for making friends, planning outings, and just having a good time! Learning to suggest activities is important because it allows you to:

*   **Initiate social interaction:** You can take the lead and invite others to join you.
