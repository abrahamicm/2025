### 2. Understanding Adapted Short Stories: A Step-by-Step Guide

Reading an adapted short story is more than just looking at the words. It's about understanding what the story is saying. Here's how to do it:

**Step 1: Before You Read (Preparing Your Brain!)**

*   **Look at the Title:** The title often gives you a clue about the story. What do you think the story might be about?
*   **Read the Introduction (if there is one):** Some stories have a short introduction that tells you a bit about the characters or setting. This can help you understand the story better.

**Example:**

Let's say the title is: "The Little Red Hen and the Wheat."

*   **What do you think the story is about?** Probably a hen (a chicken) that is red and small. And something about wheat (a plant that makes bread).

**Step 2: While You Read (Focus and Pay Attention!)**

*   **Read Slowly:** Don't rush! Take your time to understand each sentence.
*   **Highlight or Underline New Words:** If you see a word you don't know, underline it. Don't stop reading! Keep going and try to understand the sentence from the context.
*   **Use a Dictionary (Later):** After you finish reading a page or a paragraph, look up the words you underlined. Write down the meaning.
*   **Ask Yourself Questions:**
    *   Who are the characters?
    *   Where does the story take place?
    *   What is happening?
    *   Why is it happening?

**Step 3: After You Read (Checking Your Understanding!)**

*   **Summarize the Story:** In your own words, tell someone (or write down) what the story was about.
*   **Think About the Characters:** What did they do? Why did they do it?
*   **Think About the Message:** What did you learn from the story?

**Example Story (Adapted):**

**Title:** The Tortoise and the Hare

A long time ago, there was a tortoise (a slow animal with a shell) and a hare (a fast rabbit). The hare was very proud and always made fun of the tortoise because he was so slow.

One day, the tortoise said to the hare, "I can run faster than you!" The hare laughed. "That's impossible!" he said. "Let's have a race!" said the tortoise.

They started the race. The hare ran very fast and was soon far ahead. He looked back and saw that the tortoise was still very far behind. "I have plenty of time," thought the hare. "I'll take a nap."

The hare fell asleep under a tree. The tortoise kept walking slowly but steadily. He didn't stop. When the hare woke up, he was surprised to see the tortoise near the finish line. The tortoise crossed the finish line and won the race!

**Moral:** Slow and steady wins the race.

**Let's answer some questions about the story:**

*   **Who are the characters?** The tortoise and the hare.
