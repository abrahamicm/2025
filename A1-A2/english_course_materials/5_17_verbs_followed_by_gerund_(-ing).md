## 5.17. Verbs followed by gerund (-ing)

### Introduction: Why is this important?

Hi everyone! Welcome to today's lesson.  Have you ever wondered why we sometimes say "I enjoy swimming" instead of "I enjoy to swim"? That's because some verbs in English are *always* followed by a special verb form called the **gerund**. The gerund is simply the verb with an "-ing" ending (e.g., swimming, reading, eating).

Understanding which verbs are followed by gerunds is crucial for speaking and writing correct English.  Using the wrong form can make your sentences sound awkward or even confusing. Don't worry, we'll make it easy! Let's dive in!

### What are Gerunds?

A **gerund** is a verb acting as a noun. It always ends in "-ing". Think of it like this:

*   **Verb:** Swim (action)
*   **Gerund:** Swimming (the *activity* of swimming)

Gerunds can be the subject of a sentence:

*   **Swimming** is fun.

Or the object of a verb (this is what we'll focus on today!):

*   I enjoy **swimming**.

### Verbs Followed by Gerunds: The Basics

Many verbs are followed by a gerund (-ing form). Here are some of the most common ones you'll use as a beginner:

*   **Enjoy:** I enjoy *reading* books.
*   **Like:**  She likes *dancing*.
*   **Dislike:** He dislikes *washing* the dishes.
*   **Hate:** We hate *waiting* in long lines.
*   **Love:** They love *singing*.
*   **Stop:**  He stopped *smoking* last year. (This means he quit smoking)

*   **Suggest:** I suggest *going* to the park.
*   **Consider:** I am considering *moving* to a new city.
*   **Avoid:** You should avoid *eating* too much sugar.

**Important:** Notice the pattern? After these verbs, we use the "-ing" form of the next verb.
