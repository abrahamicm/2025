# Style Guide for Markdown Files

### 1. **Main Header**
Each file should start with a main header (`#`) containing the file name in title case format, with the first letter capitalized.

Example:
```markdown
# Subjects and Objects
````

### 2. **Introduction**

After the main header, include a brief introduction of 1 to 3 paragraphs. Explain what the topic is about and why it is important.

```markdown
## Introduction

The study of subjects and objects in English is essential to understanding sentence structure. Subjects indicate who or what performs the action, while objects receive the action of the verb.
```

### 3. **Sections**

Divide the content into clear sections using subheaders (`##`) for key topics. Sections should cover the core aspects of each subject.

```markdown
## Definition of Subject

The subject of a sentence is the person, thing, or idea performing the action of the verb or being talked about. A subject can be a noun or a pronoun.
```

### 4. **Examples**

Immediately after each theoretical section, provide clear examples. Use code blocks or bullet-point lists to improve readability.

```markdown
### Examples of Subject

- **She** runs every morning.
- **The cat** is sleeping on the couch.
```

### 5. **Rules and Tips**

Provide practical rules or tips to help the reader understand how to use the concept correctly. Use numbered lists for steps or key rules.

```markdown
### Rules for Identifying the Subject

1. The subject typically comes before the verb in an affirmative sentence.
2. In questions, the subject usually comes after the auxiliary verb.
```

### 6. **Notes and Warnings**

If necessary, include important notes or warnings using blockquotes (`>`) to make them stand out.

```markdown
> **Note:** Some subjects, like the pronouns "it" and "they," do not always refer to a specific person. It is important to understand the context.
```

### 7. **Key Vocabulary**

List any key words or terms related to the topic. Use bold text to highlight important terms.

```markdown
### Key Vocabulary

- **Subject:** The person or thing performing the action of the verb.
- **Object:** The person or thing receiving the action of the verb.
```

### 8. **Links and References**

If relevant, include links to other files or external sources. Use relative links to point to other files in your Obsidian vault.

```markdown
### Additional Resources

- [Verbs and Predicates](VerbsAndPredicates.md)
- [English Grammar Online](https://www.englishgrammaronline.com)
```

### 9. **Conclusion**

End with a brief summary or conclusion of the topic. You can also add study suggestions or links to related topics.

```markdown
## Conclusion

Understanding how to identify and use subjects and objects is key to constructing clear sentences in English. Keep practicing with more examples to improve your comprehension.
```

### 10. **Consistent Formatting**

* **Always use bold** to highlight important terms like key words or main concepts.
* **Write in a clear and direct tone**, avoiding long paragraphs that may confuse the reader.
* **Maintain consistent structure across all files**: each file should follow this same header and section structure to ensure uniformity in your study materials.
